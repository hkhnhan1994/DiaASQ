      "Cleaned text:  Really ? why I use IQOO9 for so many days that I feel very fragrant . If you really listen to digital bloggers , you can only buy that kind of cost  effective machine , but does everyone need it ? Does everyone play Yuanshen ? Ah , is there still a cost effective machine for the recent machine ? Is not all the hardware shrinks more than last year , the price rises ?  laugh haha  . The sub brand is basically cost  effective  the pile last year  . 9 with DC is definitely fragrant but you try again in summer . In summer , 865 , 870 and A13 A14 are all fever  sweat  . What if the fever ? at least the game experience has stabilized at high frame rate , 90 or even 120 , TM s 888 and 8gen1 is barely 60Hz , and it s even hotter than others Your IQOO9 scheduling is quite conservative . My colleague s Xiaomi Mi 12Pro is unhot every day . The manufacturers are conservatively scheduled . When running for a long time , the large nuclear frequency is extremely low  DOGE  . IQOO9 s heat dissipation stack and Xiaomi Mi 12Pro are not a level at all  laughs without speaking  . It s almost okay , the area of the hot plate is almost the same . My brother s GT2PRO is not as hot as his IQOO7 calling for a voice call . Xiaomi 10Pro s video is not hot . I suddenly felt that 10PRO would not get stuck . I hope 9000 will be better . 10PRO video is not hot ? Is there a mobile phone in this world that does not get hot when using WeChat video ? My family is poor , and the mobile phone is not hot when playing games at cold night  cute  Playing games is not necessarily hotter than playing videos  black lineblack lineblack line  What the hell    Feel the same  The chicken is hot  I return it just now  Really the first lesson for young people  10Pro s back cover is broken , still holding on , really strong Can the signal be a bit better ? No signal every day . After the complaint , I also uploaded a log . It was useless . I could nt check any problems .  Smile  , only potted plants , it reach to 999 when playing LOL . I have changed the phone card of the same package , and only my mobile phone get stuck , it is no problem for other people s mobile phones Is it Unicom ? mine often does this . Yes . In addition to being able to split the screen , the Xiaomi Mi 10pro is fully charged in half an hour , the screen is not broken , waterproof , the signal is good , and the game is fast , there is no advantage . Haha real , Xiaomi 10 I changed from Apple is really easy to use , fast charge super fragrant , I still want to use the iOS system , but Apple s signal and electricity have always made me dare not change to it  laughs Cry  . The electricity was full after I washed my face when I bought it . Now it takes half an hour  sad  I have been using 12 for the second year , and I have never had a problem with poor signal . In the second year of using 12 , the signal is not as good as Xiaomi . My boyfriend uses 13 , which is the same as me every day . Sometimes there is no signal . Except for this , everything else is fine , oh , 12 loses power very quickly  allow sad  What card do you use  DOGE  . Xiaomi  ... As a girl , I do nt know what systems and things are here , but my XiaoMi has been used for four and a half years and it really does nt get stuck at all , but the disadvantage is that the power is draining fast now  School season  You can only play Xiaoxiaole on your mobile phone , right ? There is only the mobile phone in your mind ? I have only used Xiaomi since childhood . Can you say that why do nt you like Xiaomi ? I really want to ask . Do nt come swearing  In the past two years , there have been too many bugs in MIUI , and there are quite a lot of large and small . I have encountered some small bugs , and there are many that influence to use , like force restart or something . Look at the new MIUI13 performance . I am afraid I have to wait a few months to use  Meow Meow  . Do not expect Xiaomi to be so high . After all , Huawei OV is a high end machine in domestic production . Redefine high  end  Then the signal and battery are still short boards ? Apple has always been like this . Some people say that the battery is not the weakness of Apple in 21 years . I played my sister s Apple phone and feel that the battery is still very weak  laughs  . The power of the battery is falling too fast  Yun Sad  13Pro Max rank first in the 2021 flagship mobile phone endurance testKhan  . Therefore , Apple s self made 5 G chip this time is to solve the signal problem . In terms of battery , in fact , from the iPhone11 Pro Max , the battery life is already in the first ladder . The 13 series have actually good battery life . Have you used the 13promax battery ? The battery life of it is the first among all mobile phones . Are you still say the short boards ? Four days of crashing three times or four times in three days  dirt  . My MIX4 has been many times . I also have a problem with MIX4 , and the photography camera module is still various ...  dirt  , Every one say how good photography is . After buying it , it is really  the school season   the school season   the school season  quit the pit after entering the pit . I do nt take pictures  Play games more . Generally restarting  Yun Bei  has not been crashing . Mainly this sentence is more worried , mine is the problem on photo function . boring . My Mi 6 is almost 5 years old , and mine not as bad as your IP8  Er Ha  . Who knows that Xiaomi can go back more and more , 12 is not as good as 6  School SeasonSchool SeasonSchool Season  I do nt know if it go back or not  doge  Anyway , people who smear casually are too many . Compare to Xiaomi 11 , which is better ? 11 Never used it , anyway , in the Xiaomi mobile phone I used , the 12 now used is designed for ordinary users . Offline users can transfer easily . In contrast to the surrounding colleagues , the signal is very strong , the mobile phone size is the smallest , and the game is small  the housekeeper s equilibrium mode , the performance mode of the game assistant  can give you some reference . Whatever they say , 8gen1 is hot or not . Anyway , I will buy red rice 12 at double 11  love you   black line  . I 11Pro , often 59 frames  Yun Bei  . The next time the system update will be locklaughing  . Half a catty , I have a 11 and now I always want to change to the Black Shark 4 , 870 is YYDSdoge  It seems that I have a problem with my aesthetics . I actually think that 10PRO is the best . I think it s pretty from the color scheme . The disadvantage is that flash , and the photo is a bit compromised . There is a kind of gap that looks good when taking pictures , but is actually average . I really think the back looks very recognizable and pretty , and the flash is a little incongruous , but from the whole back panel , I think the 10pro is the best looking Rice has said many times about symmetry and coordination . Not everyone is willing to spend more than 5,000 yuan to buy a very general back cover . Recognition is a must for me . Oneplus s hardware is not well . The fast charging and taking pictures are just inferior to the Xiaomi iqoo . Offline sales are bad , and the geek system has been abandoned . In fact , it s really a bit nondescript . Do nt you understand digital circle ? As long as it does not conform to their opinions , direct personal attack . Especially in the past two years , in their opinion , the flagships of major manufacturers are not worth buying . What is the mobile phone worth buying for them?It s Redmiwhat is the reason?Cheap  DOGE  The funny thing is that as long as the price of red rice is within the range they can accept  laughs  Come onhate the country s maggots , what ingredients?Laughing haha   Laughing haha   Laughhaha  . Since the other party sets up , you ca nt view the other s homepage , That s all ? It seems that you should be at least 80 years old  Yun Bei  Only 80  year  old designers have this aesthetic . On the contrary , the design of 10Pro is younger . What taste of OnePlus  Yun Bei  I do nt understand . Well , what is the situation of P50 . Xiaomi wine is good  looking and can be played . It s good  looking , and it can be played . Other than the small battery , nothing else is wrong 3300 can be used for a day , right ?  doge  The only disadvantage is that there is no 5 G . Do nt Mi fans know why not 5 G ? Does Huawei want to use 4 G ? Um , then sell sky high price . Completely aligned with reno  doge  Even the same price . Hahahaha , I am considering whether it is Reno7 or Honor 60 now . Reno7 feels that the breathing light is very good , and then the process of the back cover is estimated to be excellent . I have touched my roommate s reno6 , and it is really good . The four curved surfaces of Honor are too much to my heart . I went to the physical store and touched the four curved surfaces of the P40P , and it feels great  I do nt care about cost effectiveness , and I do nt play games . For daily use , these two phones  performances are definitely enough . Reno7 straight screen feels better , and night shots ,  doge  When the time comes , I will go to the offline store to touch these two real phones . Is the photo of the reno7 better than that of the Honor ? Then I prefer to reno7  doge  Is nt Xiaomi taking the initiative to compare with Huawei ? OPPO first produced . . . Although I am more optimistic about the offline ability of the green factory , the curved screen may be better to sell offline . The green factory s choice of direct screens is obviously a bit suspended . There is an apple appearance , do nt worry about offline . How is your 11u used ? I m still wondering if I should buy 11u  tears  Do nt play in the summer , put it in the pocket and iron the thighLaughing CRY   coordinates Guangdong  . Do nt play , is it still hot?That is the effect of warm babies  Yun Bei  . 11Pro , Guangdong does feel hot in the summer , of course , after playing . I have the same idea with you haha , and I want to have 11u . I have successfully purchased  awsl  Hahaha is so fast , are you satisfied with it ? Buy 12 series . Because I want to buy a transition machine and wait for a better MIX series , and I know that MIX should be far inferior to 11u on the camera  it is not ruled out that after several generations of MIX will improve the camera performance  , if I buy a 12 , 12 does not seem to have 11u Good photo , but not a lot of memory  But 12 only gives me the feeling of a small screen . I do prefer 11u for other parameters . The only thing is that 11u is generally said to be very hot , so I am very entangled  tears  . Do nt be a frog in the bottom of a well . Hornor dares to sell more than 5,000 , let alone OVM  yawn  Honor Magic3 series is even stronger than the Mate40 series . Unfortunately , too bad the Kirin is gone . Stop talking , brag about taking pictures very well , but the results are bad  yawn  Do nt you think mate40pro is bad ?  eat melon  He s a Hornor fan himself Manufacturers ca nt do anything about the processor , but if they do it elsewhere , they can hit the high  end . The Snapdragon has not been useless in the past two years . Its ISP is still better than that of the Kirin . On the other hand , the image that Honor has blown for so long is actually poor in the final measurement  not simple  OV is really not as good as Hornor offline now . I m talking about product strength . You talk to me about sales . Honor has lost word of mouth from the v40 to the magic3 series . It all depends on the offline measuring machine x series and the digital series . Last year , the photo system of the magic3 series was not as good as Meizu  slap in the face  More narrow body and larger screen , can take into account both gaming and daily use  Heart   Heart   Heart  . It s almost the same as Xiaomi Mi 9 . Xiaomi 9 is 74.67 mm , and it is a straight screen . Xiaomi 12 is nearly 5 mm narrower than Xiaomi 9 .  Heart   Heart   Heart  . Can Xiaomi 11Pro replace it with the old?It s been used for half a year after I bought it , the heat is serious , and the hand feels too heavy .  Smiling  . Fat water comes to the front row  warm  . Is nt this DXO s reviewer fat water  longing   longing   longing  . Xiaomi has been hammered miserably , not to mention the price  performance ratio . Others have Samsung screen , micro cloud platform , ultrasonic fingerprint Samsung screen Xiaomi is not ? It ca nt take pictures , what else ? Stupid , Xiaomi s screen is the domestic screen that you look down on . Only the minimum configuration is a domestic screen The micro cloud platform is useless , gn5 is not an upgrade of gn2  two hatwo hatwo ha  . It can only be at the same level as 766 , let alone 707 . The actual performance of 707 is not good .  Khan  I went to Xiaomi House to see it , to be honest , the camera is average . You ca nt just look at it , you have to rely on the comparison . The 12p 706 is almost the same as the 11u in terms of night scenes , only the resolution is a little worse . Micro PTZ is anti  shake technology , nothing more than ois sounds more advanced . The gn5 is Samsung s 766 level , which is completely inferior to the 707 . Brother Zhan said that the gn5 is not even as good as the 766 , and there is only one ultrasonic advantage left . Is this called a overwhelm?Allow sad  is Xiaomi 12pro not Samsung e5 ? laugh to death  Allow sad  If I had nt just sold 11 , I would believe it . Would Xiaomi a new sensor a year optimized?why 10S s HMX is beat by the cheaper NEO5 598 ? Is the 100 million pixel direction right?Essence Yes , yes , you are right  like  . I hope k50 can take photos a little better  School SeasonSchool SeasonSchool Season  Taking photos is really important  No matter how good the camera parameters are , it is useless without technology  doge  I went to the store to try the 12 and 12pro , the 12 s photo is far worse than the pro s I agree with the photo too  The top  level configuration version of the camera can also be enhanced The light is dark at night , and it is inconvenient to scan the code when going out . The telephoto scan code is even more fragrant . Do nt consider taking pictures using Redmi , Xiaomi is better  DOGE  .  Doge   Doge   Doge  Yes , I do nt know if you have encountered it , my K40 game is always 460  Tears   Tears   Tears  . The Kirin 980 will fight for anoter two years . Honor V20 has been used for three years , and it is also this processor . It is not stuck . The most annoying thing is the running memory  I ca nt open three softwares . I have to re  enter when I switch back . I ca nt open them all the time . I m so annoying . I want to save money to buy Apple  doge  Banned a lot of Wisdom xx with the little black house , now you can save six or seven apps in the background , do nt kill the background anymore Why do you say a bunch of things I do nt understand , what is black house , and wisdom?You tell me how to operate , I am too uncomfortable . V20 can also fight for three years  DOGE  . I am V10 . Xiaomi s mobile phones are stuck now . Unless it is 13 , it is more and more stuck  doge  Why , is nt it good ? My family bought 6 Xiaomi mobile phones , and they all broke after about a year . What s even more abhorrent is that a mobile phone broke down in less than a year , and it was hard to find a special maintenance point . It even said that I had dismantled it and asked me to pay 300 yuan for the maintenance fee . I took it back without repairing it , and it was only 30 yuan at a nearby store . So  Xiaomi phones are rubbish . So it s not as easy to use as my oppo . After using it for four years , except for the lack of memory , everything else is fine , and it wo nt be broken . I saw that my friend s Xiaomi Mi 11 took good pictures , and I m a little excited . Holding the Mi 9 for two and a half years , there is no problem except that the battery life is not good , and the camera can not keep up with the mainstream . why ? It s from Huawei , is nt that obvious ? Is Xiaomi 11 recommended to buy ? Just like and dislike , I m the kind of person who does nt like millet The price is not bad 11U said  all are little brothers  doge  refers to the back design  The 11U rear camera module stands out too much , which vivo has done better . The next generation of Ultra has changed again , and Xiaomi really has no inheritance . . . In fact , the design of 11U is very beautiful , and it is also recognizable . The recognition is too great iQOO can be regarded as a firm high  end , Xiaomi has not hurry to learn  doge  ? Now I really do nt understand which of the X series and iQOO is the son of vivo ? If you do nt ask for anything , you only care about the screen , and you are not afraid of diving , then Samsung . In addition to these two , other aspects are beaten by other brands  laugh cry  . Will the price really dive ? It s been over a year since I saw the price of the note20u dropped by more than 1,000 yuan . Any one of them has dropped more than this . Where do you see ? Of course it is the shop I bought ... I bought 6799 , now 5999 , less than a year and two months , the Apple 12 series will discount about 1700 in half a year , and it is the official website  laugh  . Samsung will be fine as long as it does nt buy the first launch . There is no diving . The value preservation rate is much higher than that of Apple . It s too exaggerated to beat , Samsung s camera is excellent . To be honest , Samsung still has the down hand in taking pictures at the same price . Game consoles around 3000  4000 , does Huawei recommend ?  dirty  Huawei ca nt play games , and it s all 4G. Is the iq7 in your hand not good ? OK , the account is Huawei , I want to change Huawei  Yunbei  What game , and also use a Huawei account ? so smart Huawei is not suitable for playing games Game console ? Huawei ?  Yun sad  Xiaomi 10U 5x telephoto , you know everything  doge  Currently in use , very comfortable , wait for a mobile phone that can beat him in all directions before changing Which phone ca nt beat Xiaomi ? you are really a frog in the bottom of the well Ca nt compare to Changxiang s powerful machine king , beat Android and Apple s flagship machines  dig nose  5 times is ok , the strongest overall is still Huawei mate40pro and Samsung s21ultra  doge  Yes , but its price is quite fragrant  hee hee  Overall , it s one of the top Indeed , my Mi 10u is the most comfortable for taking pictures Indeed , the focus is a bit abnormal  eat melon  Right , true MIX4  When it falls , it becomes a box  insidious  MIX3  fold  What , can it be worse than us ?  Begging for mercy  Haha , I have both mix4 and fold , it feels good to use together  laughs without speaking  MIX4 is okay , Fold is really not good  doge  Manufacturers finally found that they were almost pitted by so  called digital enthusiasts . The market does nt care about  true full screen  at all In order to make the ceramic thick and heavy , the frame becomes wider , plus 888 , I will not buy it . If the k30p is replaced with 870 , plus the high brush and double lift , the plastic wrapping is removed , the price will increase by about 1k , and it will kill all kinds of flagships at the same price . Hot knowledge  none of the manufacturers with normal brains will release a mobile phone with a mechanical structure in 20212022 . No one with a normal mind would buy the 870 of 3999 . The main configuration is not well , excluding the screen The camera is nt bad at all Samsung s screen is top level , but 2 major disadvantages  1 outer screen is too thin 2 creases are scary I like Samsung s flip very much , but unfortunately I have nt bought it because of battery life , and I m still waiting Agree with you , I wanted to buy the latest flip some time ago for my wife Wait for the iteration of the later version , the battery life will be better , let s talk about it If you care about creases , it seems that the creases are well controlled , you can consider . I bought it for the first time , it has been returned , the external screen is too bad Haha , after all , I will do it for the first time , I hope it will be better next time In fact , to be honest , the crease is just uncomfortable to look at when the screen is black , but it does not actually affect the use of  allow sad  Yes , but I really ca nt accept it What aspects of the configuration of the big detective are strong ? ? You look at the price first Strong in battery life , the system is not updated , fake DC lighting , WiFi internet disconnection , images are not unable to adjust Mainly because there is no belief like Xiaomi  too happy  The top version of the exploration version is almost 1000 less than this comparison , and can beat it casually . To beat the Honor 60Pro casually  laughs without a word  Is Xiaomi 12 U 5000 mAh , is the fast charge faster ? Do nt believe Xiaomi fast charge , it will be cut If you cut it , it will come back , what are you afraid of ? Xiaomi is updating too fast  Yun Bei  I found that the charging became slower in July , and then upgraded to 12.5 . It has been half a year now and has not recovered . The 5000 mAh battery also depends on how the battery life is . Is nt Xiaomi 11 Bo a 5000 mAh battery ? Why is the battery life so bad ? It s you who konw cloud evaluationHahaHaha  Do not talk nonsense . I look at Xiaobai database . Xiaomi 11 s weak battery life is not good . 120 dual electricity 5000  Doge  Which of the most impressive mobile phones ? Nova3 is also very easy to use The appearance I bought a few years ago is also good looking now , but unfortunately it was broken last year . Indeed , the style is beautiful and lightweight now Honor play , the pioneering work of the play series . The metal body is very resistant to falling . It has been used for three years and has been dropped no less than 20 times . It is not damaged , but it is slightly worn . Kirin 970 can fight again .  But the later play actually dropped from the mid  end machine to the low  end machine , I hate Hornor  The later play series is e  waste . Honor Play is really the first mobile phone I bought in college . Repeatedly considering the comparison , it is very easy to use . It s a pity that the later Play series made me greatly disappointed I am still using it . Except for battery life , the charging speed is slow , and there are really no other shortcomings . But I changed my phone right away , but unfortunately it is no longer glory . Nokia 5230 ? 5800 Let me see who dares to buy Xiaomi Miracle     Meow Meow   previous 10pro user  I have to say that in recent years , Xiaomi mobile phones have been very bad , and basically every one has some problems . I used to be a Mi fan , but since I used Mi 9 , I realized that the workmanship of Xiaomi mobile phones is really rubbish . After using the phone for a few months , all three buttons are stuck , the charging is intermittent , and the battery is also very poor . Later , I decided to switch to Apple . After using it , I realized that the Xiaomi mobile phone is really garbage . Hahaha , shocked , Xiaomi mobile phone has a strange product control problem  like  All three keys are stuck , you really NB Is nt that normal ? I repaired it once in less than a month and then it happened again . Later , I decided to buy Apple . It s boring to follow the trend  weak  I Play stalks , I am also rice noodles myself Now if you say that Xiaomi is not good , you have to prove your identity first . I ve seen it , the Pro camera is down , waterproof , battery down , wireless down , and now the 11Pro is only 3900 Taking pictures is not considered a step backwards .  Pick your nose  , 12p pictures are more comprehensive , and 11p pictures are more focused on the main camera  and telephoto  . The battery is regressing but charging is fast , the body is thin , and the wireless is flat is not a regress  it ca nt progress  . In addition , the screen is better , theoretically the battery life will be better  with ltpo  , the dual Yang is more powerful and looks better  subjectively  , and the 8g1 has better performance than the 888  there is no measured energy consumption , let s not mention it  . Buy a new one instead of an old one . 400 battery is not worth changing to ltpo , not to mention that the new 8 processor is a large fire dragon , strong heat dissipation means strong power consumption It can be seen on the Moto that the energy consumption of the Snapdragon 8 is better than 888 . Specifically depends on consumer feedback . Xiaomi mobile phones have gradually moved towards commercialization . Now the mobile phone industry has basically reached a bottleneck , and it does nt seem to be meaningful for fast charging to popularize 120W. I bought one after the release of CIVI , and I felt that Xiaomi mobile phone focused on the experience . It s better to keep the system stable . First of all , the camera experience , the quality will definitely beat the 11Pro . The battery is smaller , but the new customization density is higher , and the battery life is definitely better than that of the 11pro  wireless is not a step backward , it is a maximum of 50w , and he ca nt help it if he wants to increase it  And support the latest technical support  Easily beat 11p ro  11pro is now 3299 I think it is too expensive , you still have 3900 ? Graduated from junior high school to mi5 , high school graduation enters MI9 , I am the king of leek All have been met by you  two ha  It s okay , I m more looking for texture , these two textures are good , but the battery life is too bad , and now mi9 is used to watch videos Mine is also Mi Jiu I also use the Mi 9 and there is nothing wrong except to the battery life . really Did Mi 9Pro speak ? Xiaomi s quality control is getting worse and worse . The loyal fans of Xiaomi who have come step by step from Xiaomi 1s have now lost their fans From the beginning of 2018 , it is Huawei . You are loyal to the wool  eat melon  Obviously it is a consumer , but it has to be the dog of the manufacturer .  Unexplained  Look at what I use , you are a diode that does nt understand matter  of  fact , so do nt talk about it  Unexplained  It s been bad all the time . I bought a Xiaomi note , and the touch was not working when I put it on the table . I have nt used Xiaomi in the next few years . The failed product is too harmful to the brand . Xiaomi Mi 2s is still very good hot It s really not as good as before . My last Mix2 also had a crash  like signal . Turning on the airplane mode and then turning it off take a long time to restore the network . The Note9 I use now also has this problem . Wo nt buy millet again Black 5 It s ok , I ve been using it recently , the Xiaomi Mi 10pro is a 100  megapixel camera , it s not as good as the iQOO5 . How can you make me , a former 10Pro user , feel so bad ? Is nt this 11ultra ? Android light is still pretty , taking pictures is also very good Um Yes The 10 Pro is slightly worse . To sum it up  Buying Apple is the right thing to do  laughing  Not as good as Huawei , the price is much higher than Huawei . The actual experience is not higher than Huawei . Really dare to say , when you change to a new Apple , come back and brag for Huawei What s the matter with you ? It s like I do nt have 13 , do you want me to use 13 to send you a Weibo authentication ? The iPhone 11 started to get stuck after just over a year of use , and it would quit suddenly . Last time , it shut down inexplicably . I thought it was out of power , but it turned out to have more than 30 power . When I used the 5s for several years , the phone was dropped so there was a crack , and it did nt get stuck . Now this 11 is really speechless . I can only say that Apple phones are getting more and more pitted . It feels like ... no fate  I used 6S to change to Huawei every day and I want to smash my phone every day . Finally , I changed 11P to liberate ... Someone used the bad Huawei to choose Apple , some people used it that it was not easy to use . Apple selected Huawei  Er Ha   Er HaI saw that Apple s coverage rate was close to 100  and now it has a place  laugh cry  Huawei is twice the money , and the gap with Apple is not very big . Use this more than 3000 yuan mobile phone and change it again in the middle , it will beat the iPhone 7 Yeah , and that s just a comparison of how things work . There are also battery durability , after  sales replacement battery price , charging speed , signal strength are did nt compared yet , which have a great impact on the experience . The mate9 is a 22.5 watt fast charge . I have nt changed the battery of my first old m9 . Now the standby is good and the signal is good . I hope that x80pro will not use Orion anymore  two ha  I did nt buy X70Pro mainly because I am not satisfied with charging  Laughing Cry  Hahaha , the x  series charging has always been bad  doge  I read on the Internet that the signal with the 1080 processor is poor , I do nt know if it s true The X60 I bought for my mother last year , Zeissga has attracted me for a whole year .  Laughing Cry  , in my opinion , high  priced and low matching is also cheaper than high priced and high  priced . It ca nt attract me without Leica . Mi has only a smart home attracting me . I dare not touch the price of the fruit . I ve been using it for 6 years . Tianji 9000 At present , X80 will only use the brother and Qualcomm It should be that red rice is used too much , you need to learn mix The quality of MIX is also average . Various problems , Xiaomi is cost effective , but the quality control really do nt dares to compliment . Xiaomi Mi 8 ca nt be turned on for 20 days after I bought it ,  Tan Shou  let it go back to the factory for repair MIX2 takes 15 hours a day , and there is no problem for half a year . Big brother , it depends on the probability , not to say that every one is faulty  laughing  Just for your sentence , please see what equipment I used to reply to you , mix2 , the quality is very general . Do nt make fun , zz , even if I am a Mi Fan , I admit that Xiaomi hardware can not be used normally for three years , at most two years , My screen  closing button has been released , and I can directly start the screen when I open the screen . The fingerprint does not press To be honest , if you want to use a mobile phone for three or five years , it is recommended that you use Apple directly . Android phones also have Android phone usage . After one or two years , you can replace one . In a few years , the cost is similar to using Apple . Of course , it is needless to say that rich people renew their apples every year . I m not talking about three to five years , , , , Apple will get stuck in five years . Well , my Mi 6 , on a not  too  high table , slipped and fell to the ground because of the slope and smoothness . The back cover was completely broken , and the frame was slightly Knock deformation , the mix2 opens the screen directly with fingerprints , only use the power button when the screen is off , but the button is very loose in less than a year , although I am a rice fan , but I must admit that Samsung flagship will not be like this for two or three years , this is quality The quality of my red rice is also good . I bought an insurance and ran naked . In fact , for consumers , as long as it can be reflected in the increase in battery life .  Yun Bei  Like the battery life of this generation of apples , it does have greatly improved . The improvement is because the battery capacity increases 13Pro does not have more batteries than 12Pro , and the battery life is still particularly obvious ... How much is 4352  3687 ? Is nt this not much ? If the apps are really adapted , the iPhone s battery life will be down , but ... many apps obviously ca nt run at 120Hz , some of Xianyu s interfaces are OK , some apps  transition animations can go to 120Hz , and slide back down to 80  this refresh rate is My guess  The battery life will not decrease . Generally , the native H5 app does not need special adaptation . Xianyu has many flutter pages so it does nt fit , but flutter actually supports promotion It is recommended to take a look at Douban . When you swipe quickly , his homepage can run to 120 , and the book video interface can run to 80 . When you click on the book video details , he locks 60 again . Haha . It should be because the details of the book , video and audio are the controls written by Douban itself . ltpo and A15 are the key My Mi 8 battery is not durable , and the transparent version is too troublesome to return to the factory  Yun Bei  I want to know , can I change the battery without returning to the factory  Yun Bei   Yun Bei  I do nt care about the dust in I thought about it too  laugh   laughs cry   Yun Bei  I do nt know if it is Mine was on the bus , and the brakes of the car did nt hold steady . It slid from the rear seat to the door . Two corners of the rear cover glass were shattered , but it was nt too serious and was not repaired . I do nt know if hemp is troublesome  Yunbei  Trouble , although it is not expensive to repair , the coordinates are Chengdu , and the repair will be sent back and forth for a week . I sent Xiaomi Mi 8 for repair some time ago , and after screen is replaced , it is sent back the next day . The glass back cover is not in stock . Later , I bought a 18 yuan sticker on Taobao and posted it  Yunbei  Just change the battery  hee hee  It is very troublesome to return the transparent version to the factory  allow sad  It was a pity that I did nt buy the transparent version at that time , but when I went to the after  sales to change the screen , I suddenly felt that I was fortunate that I did nt buy the transparent version  eat melon  What people ask are Xiaomi Mi 12Pro and  13  Doge  It s the truth , otherwise I wo nt ask the image questions of the two mobile phones . How can the standard configuration compare to the Pro version ? The 12pro has 2x more telephoto lenses than the 13 , and the 13 has more displacement image stabilization , a better main camera and an ultra  wide angle than the 12pro , plus a newer processor and better battery life . So buy new and not buy old is it possible ? The price is about the same , it is possible Also match ? How can Apple compare to my Mi  laughing  Really ? so exaggerated It s not an exaggeration , it s the truth , the backstage was killed , and the swipe did nt follow but stuck , I could nt stand it . The battery life is a little better now , it s fine without 2 K Oppo system has good reviews now I bought an oppo flagship Find X3 Pro , the top one , now it s stuck every three to five Yes , it is true , I am realme , the system is really not good , I got my phone out In the future , support Meizu and Apple  DOGE   DOGE   Doge  , Even if you kill me , I wo nt buy anything from the Green Factory . I bought a GT for the elders , 888 , and there is no response from time to time . I dare not buy Realme for the elders in the future . I am responsible for me . I use GT , the system is quite stable , now the 3.0 fresh adopter version is a bit small , but there has never been the automatic black screen unresponsive you said . I am also responsible for what I said above . If you go to the Realme Forum , you ll see that I m not the only one having this problem , of course I believe you have never encountered it This is called survivorship bias . You can find it in all mobile phone forums , and there are more than one . It is unconvincing to say so . How are you responsible ? You will know when you go to the realme forum yourself . Anyway , when you meet , you wo nt be standing here talking without backache Last year , I feedback the various problems of the Realme system on Weibo and Tieba , but was scolded by some fans . They mean that it was a deliberate discredit Realme . Saying that I did nt have this problem and how you encountered it ? Later , I also posted some BU G screenshots to show them . Some brands NC powder does not allow you to say that it is not good at all .  Yun Bei  In terms of parameters , it is better to be ZTE anyway  but Fat Water recommends 4000 gear , who has no brain iPhone  Doge  who approves , who is opposed ? The 4,000 yuan iPhone is really a beggar among beggars . The battery life is poor , the charging is slow , the signal is poor , and the memory is small and limited in use . Is it necessary ? 4,000 yuan can be used on the top Android , is nt it better than the beggar s version of the iPhone ?  doubt  Four thousand top with Android ? Live three years ago ? Last year , 618 and Double Eleven Xiaomi 1 increased the price . The top version is indeed more than 4,000 . Do you have any questions ?  Doubt  , Apple is not discounted , you can buy it quickly  I oppose  Er Ha  Mi 11Pro , Iqoo8Pro , OPPFINDX3 , a large number  Er Ha  Mi 11p ? Is nt that 2,000 yuan gear?2889 3000 gear  Two Ha  But for people who have nt used Apple , that system has all shortcomings except to smooth power saving . Apple s disadvantages are mainly signals now , and the performance endurance is overwhelming . Good guy , my ideal combination  laughing without words  currently P30P  13P dual holdings . It is expected that the human high quality double holding of human beings will be realized this year .  Stealing  I also have P30P  laughing cry  After upgrading Harmony , it is still very smooth Indeed , it feels even smoother than the new machine  laughs haha  but the lack of old Zhou Dongyu and high brushes makes him a little behind . I plan to use it as a backup machine for my dad and buy a new one  meow  Mainly Zhou Dongyu , otherwise there is no obvious short board Just change to P50P within the scope of consideration  stealing music  May I ask what the backup machine is used for when dual wielding ? It s hard to say , I have a card that my personal information is probably leaked . There are harassing calls and messages every day . The backup machine is mainly for harassment and interception  cold  and I want to experience the flagship photography of the Android camp in the past two years  stealing music  It seems that my findx3 boarded a right car . Waiting for Huawei to come out Brother , do you have this problem with your x3  screenshots and pictures saved by WeChat will be placed on the first page of the album , that is , the album that should only put photos . Just tried it , there was no situation you said Thank you , it should be my software problem Find X3 , if there is a 12 G memory version , it will be fine In fact , it s okay , that is , the Z axis motor , and the C11 Taikoo board is not very good . I feel very satisfied with others . I got on the car 3099  DOGE  I just upgraded the CO12 yesterday , but I have nt felt the difference from 11  Yun Bei  My classmate x3 feels very stuck when using it . Opening the program and the refresh rate feel very stuck , and taking pictures feels like that . Open the app and feel that the card is because of ltpo . This phone seems to be 90hz when you open it , and it is strange that it is not stuck at 120hz before . What is a refresh rate stuck ? I do nt understand , of course you can let him use your iPhone  doge  No , no , he was stuck when he went back to the desktop to change applications , and ltpo is useless . H and s have been used , it is easy to compare , why is there so many votes of h I have used 11Pro , Note10and Mate30pro5 g . I feel that the latter and the first two are not the same level at all ... The original price Samsung is not worth it , but PDDN10  6199 and Mate are hundreds of differences , and the cost performance comes out  Doge  The screen speaker work system , plus Google service is much better . Personally , I think the flagship is acceptable to be expensive , but it is not acceptable to have shortcomings ... A broken heart will not get better for a while . Samsung is the world s number one seller , but why ca nt it be in China . Anyway , no matter how good it is , I do nt use Samsung , I do nt use Samsung for anything I have used Samsung for the first time this year , and it feels okay There is a green line on my X screen , just placed an order for N10  ... Home advantage OnePlus is an OPPO subsidiary . Regardless of whether it is believed , OPPO and One plus workmanship is better than Xiaomi Anyway , I do nt believe it , if my parents were not by the physical store OV pit ,  Dig nose  The brand is improving , I do nt like ov either , but they have changed their strategy from high price and low configuration The individual brand is slightly better than before , and there are still many offline machines No , no , no , it s been 1202 years , and people still talk about workmanship As long as there is a bad mobile phone , there is a problem with the mobile phone workmanship , and the feelings ca nt buy it . In this case , as long as the mobile phone is broken , it is a workmanship problem . Selling your phone is really a high  risk event I thinks Xiaomi s mobile phones are good  looking . There are Xiaomi 4 bamboo back cover Xiaomi note1 white note2 silver Xiaomi 6 Xiaomi note3 Xiaomi 9 transparent version Xiaomi CC9Pro white Xiaomi 10 youth version white peach Oolong Xiaomi 1 1 youth version Xiaomi 11 white RedmiK20 Pro white K40 White 10S white mix2S full ceramic white mix4 shadow green gray and ceramic white Where is my K40 G ?  Eat melon  I think the K40 G looks good without the two shoulder buttons Shoulder key decompression  eat melon  Xiaomi Note2 is here , bilateral glass feels really good  DOGE  At that time , the glacier silver was very good like the MIX4 silver green ash now .  Doge  mix4 white looks much better than that dirty gray  allow sad  I studied art , and I feel that the gray is quite sensual and advanced . Me too , is nt it high  grade gray , it s definitely dirty and has no hue after watching it for a long time  doge  Not good battery life ? No android can match the 12 pm battery life  eat melon  , and the battery is still 3700  It s too expensive , ca nt afford  Yun Bei  , the charging speed is slow  Er Ha  The charging speed is actually not bad , it can charge seventy or eighty in thirty or forty minutes , and battery lifetime is more important to me . My one plus 6 s battery life is really bad , there are shadows  two ha  It takes more than an hour and a half to fully charge 20w . I really ca nt accept it . It is not good for the mobile phone to charge while playing , and it is not good for the mobile phone to charge it overnight . If the battery life is 12promax is okay , and the others are still broken . Only considering battery lifetime , Apple is not the first choice , it can only be said that I really like it . My Apple is used as a backup machine . The biggest advantage is that there are fewer advertisements and it is comfortable to play games , but I still prefer Android for daily use , mainly for convenience . Do nt be nonsenseDont cheat yourself  Haha   Haha   Haha   Haha  It made me laugh . I consume 30  of the power in three hours . How Huawei user can be so conceited ? I also use Android , do nt you know the power consumption of Android ? I suggest you use 12promax for a while and come back to bb , okay ? Maybe your p40 battery life is still ok , but the battery life of 12 pm is smaller than yours , and the battery life is better than you  contempt  Do nt tell me whether you are patriotic or not , I support Huawei , but now 12 pm is more in line with my needs for battery life  white eyes  10s is fragrant Charging , feel , weight , and camera appearance are all 12x wins , but 10s sound quality , sub  camera and battery win  Erha  Although the 12X battery is 200am smaller than the 10S , the 12X screen is smaller and more power  efficient  meowmeowmeow  Feel , the screen and charging pull a lot  Tears  I think that the price difference of 500 yuan can accept these shortcomings I feel the same way . Although the screen is poor , they are all Huaxing haha Huaxing feels better than Samsung E4 , brightness , quasi , color gamut , etc . , and the view is also good . Yin and Yang weird , can you just say it directly ? Ok , Mi 12x is the worst in the same camera hardware . Do nt buy Xiaomi with a letter . Is nt that the digital series left ?  Yun Sad  Okay , Xiaomi s so  called super  bottom 12Pro is also very bad for taking pictures .  School season  The night view is not as good as that of the iPhone . It s a waste . Okay , Xiaomi s so called oversized 12PRO photos are also very bad  Starting Season  Night scene is not as good as iPhone It s not light , very handy Do nt do too thin , 8 mm is ok . It s too thin and it does nt feel good , refer to civi and Meizu 18 Meizu 18 8.1 mm  Not simple  Poor 4000mah poor heat dissipation , what is the use ? You said that it is not light , then it is not a small screen Battery , wireless charge , and the cameras were chopped , and naturally it was light . If you want to stack it , you want to be light , afraid it is impossible  doge  If there is material , it can be  doge  Can there be less than 200 ? That can be  Er Ha   Er Ha   Er Ha  Mi 11 is 196 . He said it is not light , it means that it will not be like Renocivi these machines 170 up and down It is really small , I know it after using the S20 , the feel is just right  But S20 is only 6.1 , and it is much worse than 6.3 A difference of 0.2 really makes no difference . Compared with the current mainstream 6.8 , it is already very good . According to you , there is no difference between 0.8 and 0.1 I am still using 5.15 Xiaomi 6  Laughing Cry   Laughing Cry  The 6.2 screen is about the size of the Xiaomi Mi 6  DOGE  The most important things are that the s20 is narrow and feels really good Xiaomi 8 users pass by and should not start again . A few friends are still using I m still using it as a game console . I m also Xiaomi Mi 8 , it seems to be very easy to use , I ve been using it for three years  dumbfounded  Run  I have also used it for three years , and only changed it this year . After the change , I use the Mi 8 again . Dimensionality reduction experience Battery problem , Xiaomi 9 s transparent board should be regarded as a milestone product . Mine is the frequent black screen a month after I bought it , and I went to the after  sales to refresh the machine . Then the battery is not durable . In the comments , people who shouted 865 yyds every day , 10U and 11P at the same price , which one do you buy  Doge  Then it must be 10U , 11p to change 10u and it is very comfortable  Laughhaha  After all , the positioning is different . 11P is compared to 10p  two ha  10Pro is better than 10u , the dual speakers and Samsung screen are far bette r than 10u , the best one tuned by hmx , the three  dimensional feel is far better than 10u Lol , only the speaker is stronger . The screen is transparent and the refresh rate is high . hmx was only adjusted this year , what happened to the phone last year ? What is the white balance of the Mi 10 ? Why did nt you say that 10u took the first place in the blind test ?  doubt  The new unpacking 10Pro bought by Xiaomi House 2999 Xiaomi House was very fragrant Is nt the 10POR stopped production for a long time ? The inventory of not selling Why do nt you buy a k40 pro , but a k40 I ca nt afford  tears   tears   tears  I even bought this k40 as a second  hand phone from Xianyu  tears   tears   tears  With a budget of 3000 , I look at the recently released new machine and feel crazy and messy  cracked  3000 you can only wait for the cost effective machines of Redmi Realme and IQOO The times have changed , 3000 can only choose cost effective The requirements are too high , why do cost  effective machines need , 5 g , high  brush , good screen , large battery , fast charging , etc . As a result , the price of cost  effective machines has all increased , and it is about to top the previous price of the main brand . I have a budget of 4000 , and I ca nt choose a 120w one  Allow Sad  Redmi Note11 Pro is only two thousand  Cracked  The configuration ca nt keep up , thank you for your kind recommendation . However , the year  end bonus has just been issued , so it should nt be a problem to rush to 11u  laughs without saying a word  Me , too . the budget of 3000 may depend on red rice Yeah It s better to buy 18pro with 500 cheaper and 30  eat meloneat meloneat melon  30 mobile phone was fined 25,000 for advertising It says server failure The failure is the fault of Meizu , not the user s fault . Besides , Meizu said that it was a system failure , but it was just a unilateral rhetoric . We did nt know if we did not . We only know that there is indeed an advertisement No Yes Good price It s not easy to use  doge  , the pictures are really blurry Both are the same In fact , the imx686 film effect of k30s is not as good as that of red rice .  doge  Today , there will be more users to send some photos of the day or night view . Let s comprehensively judge it . I hope he is really good , but I really hope he does nt want to make a gimmick of 100 million pixels . Do a module like 686 , so as not to turn over the car Compared with my Xiaomi Mi 10u , the dark light is completely defeated . . After all , thousand yuan machine Yeah?That s so good . The first batch of goods sent are basically night scenes . I do nt know if they used the wrong model , or which lens did they use ? Or , do you have to turn on the night view mode or what is it ? Or , is there a night scene mode or not , or my expectations are too high , or I have a prejudice against Samsung s module , such as Suzhou , that night scene was really a mess , it was black and black , just a few bright spots in the darkness I have nt tried the night scene , I m not interested in this thousand yuan machine to try the night scene , just tried it in the experience store during the day , and my Weibo also has a comparison with the p40pro main camera 682 , it s really not good to take pictures Tell a joke , my OnePlus 7 T still flew up smoothly , there is no reason to change the machine  eat melon   eat melon   eat melon   eat melon  Many Xiaomi fans still do nt like OnePlus , they are really confident  Spring Tour Family  Many 1  fans think Xiaomi fans have to see 1  really fascinated confidence  DOGE  You are right , I really want to switch back to MIUI 7 Pro users do nt even see the ghost shadow of ColorOS , and even my Sony headphones have no sound after the CC package they brushed hard  Stand Hand  I am very satisfied with hydrogen , I do nt care about CC .  Doge  Tell a joke , Xiaomi Mi 9 is still flying silky , and I gave my dad the Mi 10 that was stuck  doge  Hahaha , dear son I do nt know about k40 , but when holding a real gt , the system only gives 70 frames by default when playing the king . I do nt know what s good about the overwhelming system on the Internet . There are a lot of advertisements , the small windows are even more rubbish , and even the glory is not as good  I have encountered two times that the phone will freeze after calling , and the forced shutdown can not solve that  the camera really can only scan a code . Do nt think about anything else , speechless . At that time , my brain was out of my mind and I bought this kind of crap . The blue green price  performance ratio is like this  dogedoge  Who can buy who knows , blowing all over the place I recommended one to my roommate , what should I say , fortunately he does nt understand mobile phones , I have the final say Turn on gt mode , the camera is worth every penny , you buy this kind of cost  effective camera to take pictures with a barcode scanner  doge  , I also have a k40 , almost the same I burn my hands without opening the GT mode , I will not live after opening it  Yun Bei  Yanlong 888 ca nt be hold except for gaming phones now  Yunbei   laughs  is nt it because of greed ? It also makes sense . It s aimed at cost performance  Yun Bei  IQOO does not have the 8  128 option . Personally , I think the imx707ois is better than the GN5 micro  cloud platform . The GN5 is similar to the imx766 . Is the micro  cloud platform too high  end ?  laugh cry  I m laughing to death , GN5 ? Xiaomi 12U is ready to use GN5  laughing without speaking  How can Xiaomi 12U use GN5 ? 12P uses 11.28 IMX707 , 12U GN5 use 11.5?Are you kidding ? You know nothing . GN5 is an upgraded version of GN2 , Xiaomi 11 U use GN2 , and Xiaomi 12 u uses GN5 , which is definitely  nose picking  Can you take photos by feel ? You are awesome , then you can cloudly evaluate which one is better , the sports car or your electric motorcycle ?  Personally think   I think . The hardware is all put here , why feel it . One thing to say , iqoo8p is better than Xiaomi Mi 11 for taking pictures . I have both mobile phones . When the Xiaomi phone is hot , the camera is very slow to open , and it will freeze when taking pictures , but iqoo will not . And I feel the algorith m of iqoo better . I bought 12p now , the fluency is not as good as the 11 whose memory is almost full and who has been used for a year , and the system is 12.5 ois is definitely not as good as the micro cloud platform , the pricing is the same , I ca nt figure out some people say that Xiaomi is cost  effective , but I really ca nt see where it is high . Ask you , how does GN5jn1 fight against 707jn1jn1 Equivalent 60 mm , 2.5 times optical change , OIS anti  shake S5K3P9 is no worse than equivalent 48 mm OPPO 9.7 mm , close to one centimeter thickness , uh ... its thickness drowns all advantages , for some people 6666666 , the great god of cloud evaluation , You have nt touched the real machine , but say it is thick , why do nt you say that nex is heavier than find . Is there any problem ? There is no difference at all , giving you a number will scare you to death , you will follow your number go  doge  First , I did nt compare it with nex . Second , you are an OPPO fan , which does not mean that others are too . Third , I m talking about some people , but I do nt say that all people feel thick . Do nt bother No matter how you explain it , you ca nt change the title of  cloud evaluation God   eat melon   eat melon  The feel of the real machine is thinner than that of R15 . The hyperboloid is very magical . It is recommended to experience it when you have time . Prepare an iPhone and a Meitu , give up ov , ca nt stand the dust Compromise  Yun Bei   Kneel  I ca nt stand so thick You have a little bit of this . People only need the king and the chicken . The 660 from n years ago can run well . Do you really think there will be a big gap in the same chip experience ?  hee hee  Is being able to enter the game and being able to play freely be the same standard ? Let s put it this way , Samsung s 888 ca nt play the king , and other 888s are roughly the same . See what I mean before you speak . Samsung s 888 is the only one that will automatically shut down in 20 minutes  hee hee  The Xiaomi 8 Youth Edition is 660 , it s already stuck now I do nt pay much attention to Xiaomi . The vivo of a few years ago , 660 chip , play the king for 60 frames . I know this . 660 is really hard to carry . The 835 of my classmate s S8 ca nt even play the king Depending on the test , the king 90 is the extreme , and the 888 will be stuck . At present , Android can only be 870 . Do nt be fooled by a group of bloggers who do not play games . And if you add a radiator for Samsung to play games , it will still drop frames , and there are also problems with optimization  no payment  Hmm , the same 870 , the smoothness of OnePlus 9R is not as good as K40 , pro test . Magic 4 high  end is stable  Doraemon is surprised   Doraemon is surprised   Doraemon is surprised  Whether it is stable or not depends on the final market sharedogedogedoge  The people who commented here are dreaming , what is the use of being surly ?  Tan Shou  China s market share is just to see if it will make money . It can not represented anything . Even if it s rubbish , there are a lot of people who fool a lot of people to buy it  begging for mercy   begging for mercy   begging for mercy  Samsung  I suspect you are alluding to me ?  Spring Tour Family  You are looking forward to glory so low The Honor water army is indeed a lot , but to be honest , Magic3 is pretty good , it s just that other series of products are leek To be honest , magic3 is really not good . When it was first released , my friend bought one . The photos were very bad and the optimization was poor . However , it was much better after it was updated . Compared with other Android flagship , magic3 has no advantages and sells more expensive . The sales volume of magic3 series is also not good . Your concept of high  end is really low Redmi dares to call itself high  end , What thing other manufacturers dare not do ?  Applause   Applause   Applause  OPPO mobile phone is really good . I bought the X3 . The use feel is good in all aspects  Call   Call   Call  Do you get stuck in teamfights when you fight King ? I got stuck when teamfights , several times , I do nt know what s going on I wo nt buy it for a month I bought it on Double Eleven , 8  256 , it gets stuck during a team battle , I m so annoying  tears  The Find X2 Pro I bought is also very good  AWSL  Once I was a bit stuck , it seemed that the update system had solved this bug  Cracked  The signal is very poor My signal is not comparable to the standard version of 13  Yun Bei   Yun Bei  I did nt have such a strong feeling at 12 pm before . It s bad to change to 13P I do nt know why I jumped to 3G. My friend s XR is better than my signal . Speechless As an old iPhone user , I have moved to Android . I personally feel that the Android high end machine is far more than the iPhone , and the system is not stuck . Android is not the original Android , Apple is still the original   doge   Doge   Doge  Is nt this for the game , hahahaha It s better to play games on iPhone or direct screen Android . Anyway , after using Android , I do nt want to use iPhone  Yun Bei  I think it s pretty good I could nt answer the phone for a while . alas .  Yunbei  The same , it is estimated that I will not buy apples in the future . It is too painful to go back to the countryside . The phone before Redmi K20Pro was the most successful  doge  I bought the k20Pro . emmm at first I thought it was amazing , after using it for a long time I thought emmm ... not very good It s a bit stuck now , it used to be smooth before Yes . get stuck , the signal is not good  allow sad  I changed to the k20pro from Xiaomi 6 premium edition , which all are stepped on by me . Now I have another idea for Xiaomi 12  bad laugh  12X Passing by  Pouting  I m a straight screen party . You ca nt just look at the straight screen when choosing a machine , at least it must meet your own requirements in all aspects . Buy Apple , if you want cheap , there are K40 series , iQOO7 , iQOO8 is also more expensive , of course there will always be a reason not to buy it I do nt like Apple products . Not a matter of budget , but there really is nt a desirable machine . The first generation of the handheld NEX is my standard for choosing a machine . Straight screen and true full screen . This year , I have to add that the heat dissipation should be excellent . Iqoo , good heat dissipation , good performance , and good photography It s hard for some people to be satisfied with the straight screen , various parameters and light weight . Is it necessary to open a mold and sell one  Doge   not for layer owners  The current market situation is that except for the iPhone , there is no straight screen flagship at all , let alone the flagship that is light and thin . Therefore , you are aiming at nothing , setting up a target and shooting yourself , just to vent your emotions . K40Pro , Pro , Iqoo7 , IQOO8 are not the flagships ? You like straight screen flagships , Apple Android has all  cold   cold  Then you ca nt buy a suitable mobile phone . Give up . Now the curved surface is the mainstream . There are two straight screen flagship models . If you ca nt , you can buy apple Yes . Now I want to change my phone , and the flagship machine can be eliminated . However , I estimate that in the second half of next year , as Samsung gave up the curvature screen , follow up manufacturers should follow up one after another . I personally do nt like apples and do nt consider it . Xiaomi mobile phone repair rate is the highest , which is undeniable , and the after sales policy is not good , so take off the pit and use Huawei It is recommended to buy one and try it out first . To be honest , I used Xiaomi Mi 3 before and it got hot for a week and then threw it to my sister . At that time , I also looked down on Xiaomi . Later , I changed the iPhone twice , one 5C and one 6 , The screen of 5C is often broken . The 6 is directly bent . Then I used the Xiaomi Mi 6 at the suggestion of my classmates . I found that it is much better than before . This year , it is replaced to CC9Pro because of insufficient memory . In contrast , Huawei can expand , which is good The current Xiaomi is not what it used to be . Now it s close to perfection . It s mature , understand ?  eat melon  What did you tell me ? ? ? Nonsense , do whatever you want If you think I m talking nonsense , then talk nonsense , I changed from mi fans to black I have never seen you use Xiaomi , Maimang user Xiaomi 9se , when I went to the after  sales service to replace the screen , even the after  sales service said that this machine had super multi screen failure , but it was also used as a standby machine . The system was really not good , and it often stuck . Many apps would be incompatible My 10u system is stable , I do nt know what you can complain about miui , now the stability is ok It is not smooth , the frame is dropped , the stable version is raised but the frame is still dropped . Although cos has been upgraded to 12 , there are bugs , but the fluency is better than miui , said it with conscience 11u frame drop is visible to the naked eye , 10u really does not encounter frame drop , 12.5 camera is also full frame open  allow sad  I bought the 10u for the first launch . It has been used for more than a year . Maybe the battery is not good enough , but I also think it is worth it . In April of this year , I bought the first 11u for my wife , but the price dropped into slag , and it was stuck , and they all made me cry . My 10U was broken because of the break . At that time , I bought 16  512 . The system was indeed unstable . I was kicked by the internal test . It was the Bible at that time , so I changed the glory and used it casually . Bao , is yours a 16  512 bright silver , have you sold it , if not , can you give it to me ?  laughs but speaks   laughs but speaks  Already sold it ... ? ? ? There are too many places where MIUI can roast . Although it s a little better than when 12.5 was released in the past two days , there are still many problems  sweat  From Honor 9 users  Yun Bei  Later , the latest update system became much smoother , it was much stronger than before , and it could nt be smoother  glutton  Where is Xiaomi fragrant ? You see what Xiaomi 11 is rotten , 12 The screen is so bad that I ca nt see it I laughed , there is a problem with the WiFi , the 888 is very hot , and the Samsung 2 K screen can be bought for 2400 yuan . This is not good ? It s a brainless smear Have you used it?I bought the original price of 4699 , others burned , my card slot was burned , Do nt open your mouth and say you know it after you use . Quality control is like that . Wo nt you let me talk ? I want to burn The screen of 12 is good , right ? The 12 screen is still worse than 11 The screen of 12 is not bad . My friend and I watched it offline . 11 there is no heat dissipation at all , 11pro has solved the problem of burning . Although it is still very hot , my brother s 11 is hot all day with a cooling fan in the back Yes , mine is almost the same , the rear camera is directly burnt His previous one was also burned . He took it to the official for free and replaced it . Since then , he has been living with a cooling fan If a friend s product is generally recognized in the digital chat comment area , then this product is considered a good one . If it is recognized and at the same time , the mi fans are shut up , then this product is almost impeccable  dig nosedig nose  Who buys Xiaomi , what percentage are brand fans , and what percentage are pure cost  effective users like me  laugh haha  Are nt you a prodigal ?  doge  Do nt hide it , so big eyes are there I can buy a lot of brands , it s not just one thing Now OPPO fast charging is not good , there is one thing to say . No matter how bad 65W two years ago , it is stronger than your garbage mobile phone  not easy  Indeed yes  Yun Bei  Otherwise , how else is called mi station If you do nt want to watch it , you can go , watch their changandigitaljun Couragedigitaljun . The electronic waste , like Huawei nova 8se , they will brag to you too The signal of 13pm is really bad . It s much better than my X Real , I really want to throw this X , I bought a brick  Smile  5 G on the subway is really too much than 4 G  Yun Bei  5 G is not bad , 4 G really ca nt work It s all the same . Once you get into the elevator , it s over Indeed , the iPhone signal is really bad , more than 13 Pi brother , I heard that the k50 series is going to beat the Mi 12 series again  doge  Why win ? Just in terms of workmanship it ca nt be compared . configuration is possible I support what someone said about  licking the screen  . Was nt the k20p better than the Mi 9 back then ? There is only less wireless charger , and the telephoto is a little worse The workmanship of Redmi has always been a little worse . After all , too much money has been spent on the configuration . It is impossible to give you everything so good and so cheap . It is still possible for the red rice super cup to win the millet medium cup According to the situation of this year , when it was first released , the K50 should surpass Xiaomi in game performance . After two or three months , basically no one tested it , and then started to cut it , and finally cut it to be the same as the 12 series . So do nt get your hopes up How about Xiaomi 12U s heat dissipation and battery life Do nt think about battery life if you buy Xiaomi , it s doomed to be bad nt , you know nothing Hahahaha monkeys are in a hurry , Anyway , Mine burning Wi  Fi has been returned . And now I use 13pro max , which is much more fragant . you want to die ? Doubt Xiaomi on Weibo  Rabbit  Meizu is almost sold , and the combat effectiveness of kerosene is still so strong . You can buy ten Meizu flagships . Is nt Meizu OK ? This kerosene is not good  too happy   too happy  Xiaomi diving champion added a lot of bugs , so that guys can be such a cheap protector . Meizu will close down immediately . As long as I use it stably , I will be happy .  rabbit   rabbit  The actual measurement shows that the engineering machine is improved compared with the previous generation What is the size of 12u ? Pi brother . It s not interesting . This is the consistent scheduling of the blue  green factory . The radical is still radical , and online users still need performance . If consider online users , sooner or later it will become Meizu . Online users always have a lot of work , so it is better to learn blue and green and make a lot of money offline I know what you said , offline users do nt care about the frame rate , as long as you are hot , you are garbage , but this is online , online users say online things , Meizu has survived as it is now , and it is not because of poor product strength . No matter how bad it is , can it be worse than the reno series that a lot of digital bloggers are desperately washing ? There are many reasons why Meizu is cold . I feel that this year s 18 series products are very poor . The Meizu 18 is priced at 4399 , and then the actual fever is serious , the battery life is collapsed , the camera is poor , and the charging is slow . It is really not as good as the reno series . At least , the daily use is smooth and stable , and the fever is low . Most people just chat and watch videos , and as for game , just chicken or king Do nt bring everything to the blue  green factory . Go to see if the latest evaluation of blue  green is more open than MIUI in game dispatch  Doge   Doge  So it s going offline , no matter what your game is , fever is garbage  laughing cry   laughing cry  High positioning , full experience , poor system Holding K40 , upgrade MIUI13 , at present , there is no bug . It is smooth and smooth , and also saves power You use note9pro . How do you know it save power ? I ve updated it and it s very power consuming Is it okay this time ? In the first 30  , it seems to fall off quickly , and the longer it is used , the longer it is used Open the system application , an open screen advertisement is stuck for half a day  Yun Bei  It can be closed . Find close the MIUI advertisement from station B Not so bad . The individual bugs that happened to individual people are magnified infinitely . I bought the K40 for the first time . Since MIUI12.5 to 13 , I have not found any bugs , but MIUI13 has a function that has been cut , that is , the data migration function of the mobile phone clone . Now I can only migrate the address book , but the data such as pictures can not be migrated . So , the avatar picture has to be posted on QQ and then returned to the main space and downloaded again . Is nt this a trouble ? What about trouble ? Give a bad comment on this   The 12pro battery crashed and I could nt wait to charge it three times a day , so I bought the 13pro max decisively Same feel , my current 12PRO battery is really too difficult It s been changed to 13pm , it s been an hour , the high brush is really cool How does the weight feel ? Damn , that 13pro must fail on the high brush , that s still max ... This is adaptive ... Not the kind of 120 used in Android Do nt kill it with a stick ... There are many Android mobile phones with high adaptive refresh rate . . . I hope that because of the high brush , the battery life of the 13pro can be better . I do nt play games . Pro is L2 , Langfang has already climbed the slope , and our company just provides test equipment for the whole machine . Some time ago , during the trial production , a colleague of on  site maintenance equipment touched it . According to his description , the feel of 12 is really fucking good . Is there a photo  longing   longing   longing   longing  There are 3D  Meow Meow  but I do nt want to hand over 100W  Meow Meow  Then tell me directly if it s good or not . What about 12Pro Did nt you touch it  longing   longing   longing   longing   longing  I can consider if it is 999  Applause   Applause   Applause   Tiger Claw Big Heart  If there are these , are nt apples fragrant ? I ll tell you the truth , the texture , visual impact , appearance , photography and the system will all feel that apple is not fragrant What are you thinking  laughing cry  Dreams still have to have  Laughing Cry  Okay Configuration is not equal to experience Have you ever used X70 ? Huawei s Zhou Dongyu experience is good ? 4 G better than 5 G ? You wo nt say that if you use a vivo system . I have used two vivo mobile phones in a row , and there is a lot of scolding on the vivo forum . Go and see . The vivo system is okay , it is very smooth Configuration is the basis of experience There is no conflict between the two Um . Configuration is a foundation for experience . It is true that configuration does not equal experience , but if configuration is not enough , what kind of experience do we talk about  dig nose  The main thing is that the Dimensity processor is not okay . The maintenance is slow . I would rather cut off 120W and replace it with Snapdragon  Tears   Tears   Tears   Tears  Is it still slow ? Three of the 7 models in the second batch of the enhanced version are Dimensity . K40 G K30U No Snapdragon is not all updated . The first batch is the flagship , and the second batch of the second batch of processors are Snapdragon 662665 , 750 G , 765 G , Tianyi 800U , 700 , 1100 , and the rest are naturally the third batch . I would rather 778  67W 778  67w on Pro , 870  120w on Pro , so perfect  doge  In your thinking , K50 can play a combination of fists You can buy K40 Whoever buys K40 now , buy new rather old , it has been long time . The overall strength of k40 is very strong , except for 33w , which is a disadvantage  dirty  yes find x3 is one of the most flickering OLED phones I m going , what should I do , can I only change my phone?I really feel that my eyes are uncomfortable these days Buy a bedside lamp , turn on the lamp , and play with high brightness will be better  laugh , cry  Full brightness low frequency PWM flash frequency , sufficient light will also be blind  Doge  Is it more serious than 13P ?  Laughing without words  Yes . I have been blind 12Pro is the same , white balance is not so good Xiaomi camera s team is almost 2,000 , how can the effect be like this Xiaomi s camera is as sucks as ever Same feeling I feel that Xiaomi s white balance always has a problem . Taking a picture of food with very good color , Xiaomi take it so pale , really suck Not only the white balance , but the details of the bright part are not good MIUI is much better than OPPO . My 8 g kill background program even more seriously than my Mi 8 three years ago . Mine , too . I also changed from Mi 8 to OPPO , then to the Find X3Pro . This 12 g memory is nothing  the system automatically makes that3 G memory function  . If it were not for the bad reputation of the MIUI on the internet and the flop of the 888 , I still want to change back to Xiaomi 11P or 11U . I just want to wait for the next year s 12P now So is my OnePlus 9Pro , the touch screen is not so sensitive for playing games Yes , I often touched by mistake when I played the Honor of Kings and QQ Speed . I used my classmate s mobile phone before  also the curved screen  and I did nt get false triggering . I felt that OPPO was good before I bought OPPO . Now I feel just so so  laughs  Is nt OPPO just stable and have less bug ? To put it plainly , under the bottom of Android 11 , OPPO dare not have more functions . If it have a variety of functions of MIUI , it sure will have a bunch of bug . It is a little bit more stable , but there is no qualitative difference between it and MIUI , right ? Stability is true . Just like Xiaomi often have bugs in the small window , but OPPO s power consumption is also very fast . I only care about if the price is reasonable and the quality control can be better ... All my three previous  screens are unglued . The product control of this XC in my hand is fine , but because the location of the mobile phone in the car is just above a air outlet , the warm wind blows to the back cover of the phone when it is cold , making the double  sided tape of back cover unglued . The symptoms of the two of us are the same , so the question comes  why dose the Samsung I bought did nt unglued when it blowed like this ? Probably is the problem of double  sided glue ? I went to a mobile phone shop to change those double  sided tapes , but he directly used the E6000 to sticked my back coversad  The Z3 I bought also unglued on the screen , but then it did nt has this problem on my XZP . My XZP also unglued Is nt you talking about the K30s Supreme ? Except the charging is less than 67w , the others basically in line with your requirements , and the 865 actually has no difference to 870 . K30s s camera is not good , the algorith m is not in place , the 686 of K30S is not as good as the 586 of K40 How can there be 586 in K40 , that is 582 , do nt talk about taking pictures with K40 . How can the 686 be beaten by 582 2 The charging was a bit worse , and it was a bit heavy for me , so I gave it to my dad . I am double  holding , and now it is unnecessary , but I look forward to a mobile phone which has the configuration I said . None of the 5000 mAh battery is not heavy , and your requirements are LCD5000 battery 67W fast charging . The LCD module is heavier than OLED anyway , so it will only be heavier according to your requirements . So just wait for it , you can only say that there is this expectation . K30s does nt have global DC  sad  Does LCD need DC ?  doge  Samsung hopes to keep the same worse heat radiation as Apple , so that foreigners wo nt be so addicted to mobile games like Chinese . Samsung never forgets its original intention , and gives the mobile phone extremely limited heat dissipation . Smart phones should be like mobile phones , use the GPU frequency reduction and CPU lock to dissuade the addicts . Do not do superior heat dissipation is Samsung s anti  addiction skills , which is much more better than Tencent s authentication and Xiaomi s screen time reminds . 13Pro Max s heat dissipation is very good Apple has no cooling from the design , so it is not very good . The main reason is that the processor consumption is low , so it will not be too hot in itself But Samsung has no processor as good as Apple  s.  Doge   Doge  The performance of Qualcomm is okay . Unless you plan to use a mobile phone for more than 3 years , there is no difference . Most people change it for two or three years , using longer is for the people who do nt play large games . Like my friend , he used the iphone6 for 5 years until change to XR . We bought the iPhone6 at the same time , but before he changed XR , I had changed my 6 to 6SPlus , Note7 , Note8 , S10  Eat melon  That s so typical of the lanyangyang dalao who think bingyuzhou dalao is his enemy , he breaks mysterious in a word  With more than 200 grams of mobile phones for a long time , now I really like the feel of small screen , but can they consider a large memory user like us . Is there a 512 G version in the future?This should not be a huge problem , right ? 512 G , what did you store?Hee hee   hee hee   hee hee   hee hee   hee hee  There is really nothing should not be stored , mainly because I like to shoot 4 K 60 frame videos and take a lot of photos , so I said I need 512 g , and 1 T is better  good   good   good   good   good   good   good  Using the cloud space is great How can they give you a 512g , if there is , you will stick on the mi12 No way , you see , my Xiaomi 10Pro 512 G has been used in less than two years . Although it is still very smooth , I still want to change to the new one when I see Xiaomi 12 . Feel the same Bro , 9R takes pictures is bad ? I find it has the optical image stabilization so I prepare to buy one The tuning of taking pictures is better than realme and oneplus , and the level of 9R is the same as 8T. However , because it is 586 , it must be worse than 766 , but the NEO5 is 598 , and the foundation is 586 , two inches , but with the blue factory algorith m in place , so it is still the best to take a picture with 3000 gear now , better than the picture effect of 100 million pixels of xiaomi 10s Tuning is a matter of system update , and just need two versions at most . But the hardware is fixed , 586 is always 586 , the upper limit is not high If it is two versions at most , you will not find that 10S taking pictures is still so bad . It will not be defeated by 598 , all parameters of 598 are the same as 586 , only the filter is different . It s worse than your now , and it is blured with zooming in . Why choose 9r if the realme is optional ? Just because I do nt know so I came to ask  Laughing CRY  It s not for me to use , of course , it is impossible to compare with mine ... You can get the top  equipped 9r with 2600  at 618 , now with the same 3000 , GT exploration would be better . Buy at 618 is okay , but you d better choose the master version now Thank you for the true machine owner replying Apple is plagiarisming to the leader of the industry , plagiarisming to the world s first value in the world , plagiarisming to the industry s profit hegemony , plagiarisming to the cash flowing and rich , plagiarisming to the world s most valuable brand . Those enterprises claiming lead the world are still on the edge of whether they can make a profit and survival , so tragic  laugh  Do nt have to say so . Ten years of apple fan , the mobile phone has changed the eight or nine , computer and iPad iPod iPod Touch , never missed any of them . It s design ca nt be complain , the appearance is good looking and the use is humanized . But honestly , the decline in performance in the past two years is apparently , so does the design part It is not surprising that you use the iPhone 11 to have such a feeling . I do nt feel like you with 13 Pro Max . It is not necessary to say that the smooth and silky control experience . It is an indisputable fact that the invincible battery life is completely beat all competitors . In recent years , I has been using Huawei flagships , sometimes Samsung and OV flagships , It can only be said that one is not as good as one . Especially Huawei is a landslide visible apparently . The latest P50 Pro is really disappointing without talking about 5G. I ve been an apple fan for more than ten years , with my feeling all the way . I do nt want to change to 13 , Apple is already not so perfect . Not only are the battery life , but also the intelligence of the input method is worse and worse . The reason why overseas users ca nt leave is because it can freely switch the languages of various countries compared with Android , but it has become worse and worse in the past two years You are really love your xiaomi to death . How can you laugh at they others with your empty stomach . Shame on you I do nt like the color of X70Pro , there are too few choices , yellow is ugly The real one of blue is really invincible Want white and pink vivo never has a good  looking white blue Just fine Samsung s color adjustment is really good , The iphone which can really be called nail door  I think there is an iPhone 4S  has a dual  core processor and fix the signal problem of 4  iPhone X  the start of the fringe screen , and Qualcomm baseband signal is good  iphone 12 or iphone 13pro  think 5 G is more important will stick to 12 , feel that the high refresh ratebrush is important will stick to 13pro  At present , all after 6S can be nailed . On the one hand , the performance of the Apple A series SOC has been significantly ahead of the same year s Android machine . On the other hand , Apple software updates better , the fluency of ios15 on old devices is unexpectedly improved compared with ios14 That s true , but due to the suppliers change , profits , and strategic factors , Apple has produced some products only to increase iOS users , such as 5C , SE , XR , and 11 which I think is a pseudo  digital iterations and retrograde product But to talk about whether can nail , XR and 11 are definitely capable . The overall experience of XR is better than XS  the key is battery life and heat dissipation  . the memory of 11 is the same as 11pro , 4 g. XR and 11 are strong XR , 11 are all LCD screens , Intel baseband , these two put me off Whether the iPhone should truly be called a nail door , should look at the sales volume of the single machine . As long as the base is large enough , the group of people who do not replace it will become a nail door , and the models they hold become the representative of the nail door The meaning of the discussion is to express their opinions , do nt just look at sales . I guess the post starter must use X to comment . At this time , if you are given a 13 promax for free , you can directly throw the X in your hand awayDoge  NO , which in my hand is iphone12promax It seems that the iPhone 12 Pro Max network is not good . Need so many days to reply Hahaha , I m sorry , I do nt often watch micro  blog very often I really think my 11Pro is the most convenient , the 12.13 frame is too uncomfortable . I never use phone case . I think feel is the most important . But x is really not good Anyone who is given for free will throw the one in hands awayLaughing Cry   Laughing Cry  but he said X is yyds Magic3 is okay , it is the best performance of 888 , but the photos are bad Performance is best  downgrade resolution It is much better than lock to 30 frames Exactly , its cheating means is even more than FAKEME The worst performance , the 888 , is almost the same as Xiaomi  but xiaomi at least not that bad at taking pictures  Hahaha I am also XSMAX , which is also 15.2.1 , what else can I do ? Only upgrade it directly . I am going to remain at the last version of iOS15 . wow , that cool ? So upgrade it together No way out , it s alredy iOS15 , so I can only upgrade , do nt upgrade if it is the old system Do it to the end , it s still downloading , it s too big Is XS upgrade to 15.2.1 smooth ? How about the battery life The battery life is not good , it is easy to fever , note  it is still winter  I can not imagine summer Come on , choose you because of being fooled  Love you  Stop it , see how many large versions already . OnePlus s big version update is the longest in all domestic products . Useless totally , the long screenshot bug can not be repaired for two years I have nt encountered it ... Mine is also 7Pro , how to trigger this BUG , let me try Indeed , Oneplus is not as good as the original one in the both software and hardware , I feel really disappointed as a plus fan OnePlus can earn few money , Zhang Boss is busy playing them for a sucker with OPPO My 8PRO just worth three hundred yuan for only two months . The power drop is fast , the signal is not good , just like a thousand yuan machine . The important thing is , it s too easy to be broken by fallen down , and the screen will be broken . I remember the redmi , I fell it down from the high place so many times , it s still okay , but the 8Pro fell so lightly , it was broken . I m glad it s broken , so I do nt need to worry about the power down every day . 8P is the most outrageous mobile phone I have ever used . In the case of 1080P , the screen was on for three hours .  Tears  , I tried to sell it out at a loss . Never settle ? Bah  Starting at 2499 , the appearance also costs money  doge  To be honest , I think 2599 all is very good , although I will choose the realme master s explore version The master explore version is good at taking pictures  Meow Meow  YOu can choose K40 or GT NEO2 if you do nt care about taking pictures I has been used the k40 , the configuration looks good , the actual experience sucks I recommended that give these two hundred yuan to vivo  Meow Meow  Then the price will increases to 2699 Hello Xiaobai , how to choose Huawei P50 or Xiaomi 12Pro ? Xiaomi s system is a bit bad this time , lag from time to time , what about Huawei system ? The P50 better to buy the Kirin version , because the Snapdragon uses 888 .  Laughing Cry  The P50 Standard Edition is 888 . It was okay from the evaluation , but I m very worried because of this , and the price of the Pro version is too high  sad  From xiaobai , P50 various data generally at the bottom , 888 after all If you need 5 G , then 12Pro , else just P50 Ok thanks . I have bought 12Pro , but I am going to return the P50 in my hand , but watching parameters is indeed much worse than Xiaomi , a little hesitant System  I have nt used Hongmeng and MiUI . I do nt know which one is more convenient . The screen  Xiaomi is much more better . Photography  P50 is better , I guess , but the others are not much worse . Is there a Kirin version of the processor in P50 ? 888 and 8Gen1 are not much different . You can also compare the OnePlus 10 Pro . I am using OnePlus 8 . I checked some time ago , the overall texture is not bad . I want to replace it to oneplus 10pro or iphone13 or samsung S22  in the middle and late of this year . Do nt return it , P50 is not good , if you really want to change , you should change to Mate40pro 5 G . OK , thanks Put it in the comment area , I will delete it as soon as the marketing department see it Im too happy with my K30s K30s s texture is a little bit bad  DOGE   DOGE  K30S is too thick and too heavy , I look forward to the Xiaomi Mi 12 series can achieve a large battery light body  Doge  Pro is the same as this ? The same , just change the periscope lens Why I always feel awkward ? Is there a pure white Xiaomi 12 ?  Doge  White panel  DOGE  I will buy one if it like Meizu  Doge  You really want to buy a ov with more than 8,000?I think most people wo nt do it .  Doge  I remember that the Blue Factory was not so expensive in the past two years The price will not rise so much , will it ? A few hundred yuan at most This year , all of them want to be high  end  DOGE  only the price is high  end , there used to be Huawei . Pressing the price , they dare not . Now it s gone X2PP directly up to 7000 , was nt Huawei be there at that time ? In fact , if the price of the blue factory has been there , the workmanship and texture will be fine . My rubbish 70  is like that , I know that he is very expensive as soon as I touch it .  doge  I sold my Mate40pro . I bought 70Pro . I think Huawei s texture is better . Maybe I like heavy mobile phones . Compared to it , I think the IQOO9 series is really good to touch offline  Doge  Of course , do nt want to buy an apple just for OV s stable and worry  free . NEX camera sucks , it is not as good as X80 Pro I am wondering , although I know the camera is the leading part of X80Pro , NEX is a high  end flagship , so the camera is at least as good , but after seeing the news , actually it is not as good as If they are the same , how to sell X80Pro  doge  Can expand the price gap , Indeed , the fast charging is not the extreme , and the image is not extreme . Two strong perception experiences are not extreme , but they still locate their top flagships There is no full screen , no 120W , no Zeiss , no need to launch  haha  Waiting for X80P Published Uh  huh They are all sub  brands , laughed at Redmi ? Realme add IQOO still less than the K40 series How many millions did your k40 sell ? Oh Redmi s workmanship and texture is not very good , only the configuration is high Yes , but the biggest reason for the first generation of the mobile phone case is gone Clever guy  praise  So do you recommend 12 , wait for reduce the price , ask for views Either buy 12Pro , otherwise 11 . At present , I know only two kinds of people who buy 12 . The first is they do nt know the mobile phone very much , and the second is too rich . Damn it , why , I was going to buy 12 because I have not more budget Choose 12 just because do nt have money , then since it saves money , save to the end . For most people , the 11 and 12 experiences can be said to be exactly the same . Even some people think that 11 is better than 12  LCD screen , avoid 5 G consumption and heating  . 3800 can buy a 99  new 256 G , and the normal price is now 3900 . The main reason is that the 12 generation seems to be not very good for heat dissipation , but it also depends on the machine . Some do nt . 128 g of 13 need more than 6000 , if you can buy a 12 128 g about 5000,I think it s very worthy I feel that Apple s heat dissipation every year is very bad , except for the big size X heat dissipation is not as good as 8 and 8P . XR heat dissipation is better than XS and XSM , 11 heat dissipation is better than 11P and 11PM 12 open 5 G directly become hand warmer OnePlus 9 Pro is more suitable 9P s battery life is too bad , and the camera is reversely optimize . Only cheap The battery life is almost the same , the image is okay  Almost,it seems you never used one have good battery life I bought oneplus 9P as soon as it was released . As a result , it restarted to restart and forced terminate again and again . After enduring it half a year , I decisively changed the iQOO  DOGE  1700 K40 top  end here . The price is here , what disadvantages are not important . Buddy , I want to ask which one is hotter , 12 pm or s21u  DOGE  Both are hot . But at least the signal and network of S21U are better I do nt think the Samsung signal is good , at least in Shenzhen , I think the Samsung s signal is worse than apple So the mobile phone thing is personal , different regions , personal feelings , various operators , have different experience , suitable for yourself is the best Yeah , pretty much  DOGE  Is it hot when daily use without playing games , broDOGE  If you change from 12 pm , you will find that whether you play games or daily use is fine , 888 is not as hot as you think , half half Is there Xiaomi 12 Pro  DOGE  Its main camera is much more better Well , iqoo also has ultrasonic wide  area fingerprints So both has its own merits , taking pictures 12pro is indeed a little stronger Xiaomi 12 Pro has 50 fold , it seems  Yun Bei  Xiaomi 12Pro is 20 fold , IQOO9PRO is 30 fold Who told you that is 20 fold ? you can not read the instructions if you are blind and you ca nt check it offline ? A games subsidiary brand , dare compared with Xiaomi digital flagship ? It does nt means the Xiaomi digital system optimization is really good , but it s digital system optimization like a miscellaneous machine But the Motorola is still smooth Realized by addition , I seriously suspect that Xiaomi may publish a first generation UI reprint , which will be smooth at that time . Are you stunned ? From 9 , MIUI start to add , it has changed , and they do nt know what to do to 12.5 . Yantiantangmeiyouxuefa Many bloggers evaluate Motorola nothing is right At present , iqoo9 is the worst in ltpo from review . A lot of video website locking frame . I  m the most conservative , performance release is also the most conservative . I buy it mainly for experiencing system , it  s really not suitable for me . I do nt like too conservative Not blame , IQOO9P is the worst one in 5000  at external sound ,  iPhone11 . xr . 8p . Xiaomi 11U  .Even worse than oneplus9r Just released today , have you used it ? The experience store has been around for a long time Those used for evaluation are engineering machines , the after  sale version on the 12th will be stable Hope , it feels like semi  finished products At present , the main problem is the display of developer mode frame rate . Everyone s ltpo has little difference , and each has its own advantages and disadvantages . Video website is currently support bililbili . The test results of the ex factory version of the performance strategy are quite good . You can watch the test results behind Zhong Wenze s video . The Monster mode is worth looking forward to . Seeing the review is only 60 120 like Samsung , and the video website should open up , I bought iqoo 9pro , If so , I m really disappointed , Cut everything , it s still a flagship ? Even performance is chopped , I would rather to buy terminal mobile phones . Running points with multiple cores is very strong , but it s actually quite different from running points 11 . XS s two  generation mobile phone fever and run slow is really getting worse . Really , if Apple is not being rescued , few people will buy it . It is difficult to flatter Apple now . It is stuck as soon as playing games , is it because the mobile phone aging ? It is not a fever . It should be a processor problem . Anyway , my mother and my sister bought it then return after buying it for 7 days . It was too easy to have a fever , and once it getting fever , the phone get stuck . Because it did nt get fever or stuck before , only started from one or two months , so I feel that it is caused by aging or system upgrade . The signal is poor , the fever and stuck is serious , and reduce the frequency because of heat when you use Weibo . It s useless outside . There s no signal anywhere Mainly taking pictures I feel that taking pictures now has been surpassed by various , and there is no ahead . I have used Apple since 2011 , and if I change my mobile phone later , I also will change Huawei Do nt smear it without any reason No , this is the disadvantage of 11 . You do nt believe it , buy it yourself . I m an apple fan , why I smear it ? Is there any Android flagship recommendation , do not want the curved screen  Poor  Good brother , wait , but that oneplus one is half a flagship . Wait for which?Poor  the realme GT2P . if worse comes to worst then IQOO . Others have a low probability of direct screen flagship ... OnePlus 9 12  256 2999 Is this a flagship ?  DOGE  In the direct screen , it is good . After all , the flexible screen looks better than the hard screen of E4 , and it s OK to take photos This year s green factory also has a straight screen flagship Which is the flagship of the straight screen ? Do nt talk about the inner screen or the folding screen Zhange said , higher positioning than Realme My wife is still using Mate9 that has been bought for almost 5 years , thanks to Harmony Mine has been more than five years , and it is still good  hee hee   hee hee   hee hee  Do nt play games , daily use is fine I never played the game , just the memory is not enough I also use Mate9 , already a bit slow and stuck Of course , after all , it s so many years It s barely OK . It s suitable as a standby machine , but it s relatively heavy Mate7 is still using  Doge  My mother s Mate8 is still holding on , it will always be crashing , but it always be sturdy . I want to change hers , she do nt want . Mine wo nt crash , but it s easy to shut down automatically at any time when the power is less than 30 I just like white X70Pro , it s so good looking , ready to buy , I do nt know how about 1080 processor If it were nt for this 1080 , I bought it early , the only defeat in the X series The point is , is it really that bad ? Anyway , I do nt buy 1080 , and the sales of JD.com are not much , they say low configuration and high price Run score 865 , actual 778 Really , as for ? You want to take pictures only , then X60Pro can beat 11U Squat waiting I am also waiting  hee hee  I think the only mockable thing is 55W charging Where can you get the result than can beat ? that saying ? Vivo s portrait photography , none of the other factorys can compare Understand , use Xiaomi 9 for another year , change Xiaomi 13 , after all , Wang Shouyi said 13 best I like Xiaomi Mi 9 , only the battery is too small  single dog  Indeed . Everything else is acceptable except battery life and memory Haha , can the small battery still endure ? Used as a landline It feels great . I like it very much , but the battery is too small for work , It s really unsafe Unless nova6 , Kirin 990  optical image stabilization 3X telephoto  40W fast charging , after 6 generation , nova configuration all the way down Nova7 feels okay , I played my colleague s 7 , it feels good Except that the performance , 6 is not as good as that of 7 , the relationship between 6 and 7 is a little like that of Hongmi note10pro and note11pro . One performance is full , and the other periphery is better Is the 990 of 6 not better than the 985 of 7 ? Exactly It was only about 1700 at the time  DOGE  4 G version President Lu , I now have a K20 Pro and Note10 Pro in my hand . Originally , I wanted to buy a Note11pro to replace the K20 . Do you think the Snapdragon 855 K20 Pro in my hand is still necessary to change ?  K20 s various functions are still very good  I hope Lu can answer  bow   Redmi mobile phone K20 I c ant bear the power drop . Add a Xiaomi charging treasure for two more years , alas Mine is still fine , it can be used for five or six hours at a time  hee hee  Then yours is good , mine should be the system bug , ca nt update the system anymore , watch a movie , then drop half  sad  Is your K20Pro battery life okay ? I only watch the video without playing the game . My K20 s battery life ca nt work anymore . At least charge 3 a day . Mainly this year s flagship chip sucks It s okay , mainly because I can charge conveniently , if you ca nt , just change the battery . It s not expensive Mine is not exclusive version . And the memory is a little bit small . No value . There is a problem with the screen too What Lu said was absolutely honest , but in fact , it depends on what the K20 is used to do . If you do nt play games with k20 , you can consider changing one because 120W fast charging is really cool I do nt play the game very much , just use Weibo normally and watch the TV series  bow  It s not necessary at all , you do nt play games , fast charging is basically unnecessary It s OK for apple to take photos and then photoshop the pictures . Huawei s photography of people is not as good as Apple  s. It s very strange to take photos  Front camera  Anyway , I always take pictures of scenery , and I think it is fine Pictures are good if you look good Huawei camera comes with a filter , it is unnatural to shoot people Yes , and the photos taken are different from it shows I always thought that there s only people who could nt take pictures well . It turned out to be related to the mobile phone  Er Ha  So speechless , I feel that the 12 rendering picture is not good , it s not as good as 11  tears   tears   tears  Why the color of the back lens module can not be unified with the back cover  tears   tears   tears  I think Xiaomi made you better at judging ugliness One man s meat is another man s poison . This time , the rear camera looks very commercial personally , and there is no special point . The current rendering is extremely common I think 11 is ugly  sad  The aesthetics are different . When 11 came out , I think the rear camera is actually okay . I think this 12 s rendering is a little ugly , but I have to buy it , pro , hope that it will change a bit when it is released . Should nt this be both front and back of 12 looks better than 11 ?  Doraemon Speechless  I went to watch these three models offline today . The most beautiful one is S22  , but there is no physical machine at present I really do nt understand the border design other than U this year . The original machine that was perfect was destroyed by the frame feel Indeed , the border is a bit screw up When I touched the real machine , I really could nt believe this is the S22 this year . Even if you keep the S21 last year is better  Laughing Cry  I heard that except for the U , the borders are a little harsh , is it true ? Here do nt have any physical stores to experience it . I touched it in the store . It is recommended to get U , 2222  b ack cover do cut hands too much . The arc  shaped middle frame to the back cover is completely without transition , the feeling is not good as 22fe Compared with the iPhone s signal is too real , Apple is really the worst signal mobile phone at present  laughs  I think do nt need to compare with Apple at all , Apple s signal is definitely the worst Because I am using Android and iPhone at the same time , the difference is really obvious The Apple s signal is obvious to all , especially you have no signal in the elevator . Cook , IPHONE can not remove the fringe , but should optimize the mobile phone signal  Laughing Cry   Er Ha  Cook  We know that there is a problem with the signal , but I wo nt fix it  Meow Meow   doge  right Every time in the basement , scan the code and pays the parking fee , the iPhone is going round and round , and it can not be done . Android has been done long ago  sad  There is no signal as soon as you try to scan the code I announce that the Xiaomi 12 series is the highest appearance value and the best feel among all mobile phones this year . Mate has nt come yet That pair of digging holes  laughs cry  How do you know before it released ? Only January 4th , say it is the most beautiful , really ask for smear With all due respect . Is it so good  looking ?  sad  and finding that I always feel like some mobile phones else Good looking  Doge  Because I bought it . Yeah  Laughing without saying  I feel that the apperance value of Xiaomi 8 and Xiaomi 9 are both pretty good , but the sales volume is the most bad . This time , the 12 whose leading is apperance value need to withstand the pressure Mi 8 ? Good apperance value ? Does the blogger still recommend buying Xiaomi 11Pro ? Do nt think about the screen without LTPO in the future What is the use of LTPO now ? The high brush experience is not good , and the power saving is not that much .   Recommend Xiaomi 11U , so far it is still the most powerful image system The price is not reduced I do nt like that weight  laughing  , the new Mi 12 I feels too narrow In recent years , vivo and Huawei are the best camera module designs , and the rest are not very good OPPO s module design is also okay . OPPO is the same design as Apple , just changed the direction I do nt mean FX3 , the design of the reno series is good . OnePlus is fine  7 to 9  Starting Season  The overall texture of 9Pro s back is good , but the camera alone is a bit messy . 78 is a bit so popular , it is a simple vertical three  camera , no bright spots . But Xiaomi , thissad  I really ca nt accept it . 10 , cc9p s exclamatory mark , 11 , looks weird . I prefer the K40 kind of elongated . Oneplus this simple vertical bar design , it looks pretty good among the bad designs now Symmetric beauty  Anyway , the camera arrangement combination is nothing more than those types . It looks good or not depends on the specific location and detail decoration . Hmm  doge  Silky smooth , the only disadvantage is 128 is not enough . Yes , yes , ready to change Xiaomi 12 . S22 only 8 GB Xiaomi 12 s R corner , I feel too uncomfortable , while the feel is good What does R corner mean ? Really or not  Bittering  You make me almost believe in the optimization of Samsung S10 , only when storage space has 8 G or more is smooth Impossible Just Xiaomi s quality ? Holding Redmi Note10pro , feel is so bad , really worse than other brands , anyone will regret if buy it . Who wants , 1200 to sell it 1200 you have used 1100 , you are discontent Sorry , I bought it with 1499 . You went to buy a new one for me with 1200 , do nt comment without reading questions , kneel down for me and sing sorry 1200 , you give it to me , I ll buy it for you . 6  128 . New . You can give me the money and your address . Hahaha , you go to the same price to find a mid  range machine to see if there is any better than the one in your hand . You are so troublesome Go to experience the glory X30 , do nt talk to me about the processor , kneel down for me Although the Redmi s experience is not good enough , but your glory X30 , what experience do you even talk about if the hardware not to meet the standard ? Note10p , What other brands of good mobile phones can you buy ? Read the question before you comment , read three times , otherwise never answer Ask who else has this year ? Xiaomi and Samsung are the last hope . Domestic manufacturers all try to blame on consumers with their own problems . I really treat domestic goods as treasures , and domestic goods make me cry . I want to support it , but it s hard to Must have 12u The price must take off . 12pro has no periscope , no IP68 , the price of 256 g is5000  , then 12u must be 7000  Then do nt know Huawei  You can have no confidence in me , but you ca nt without expect  DOGE  I also want to have expectations . Originally , P50 , wanted to support it . It does nt matter if do nt have 5G. Anyway , my three  line small cities do nt need it , but your screen is taht bad while you still sell it so expensive . I can afford it , but I do nt want to Apple is still so invincible XR users , have been use it a little more than three years , and going to change the battery for anothor three yearsLaughing Cry   Doge  My 8P has been 4 years . I changed the battery and felt that I could use it for anothor 3 years . 6.7.8 all feel very durable . My friend s 7P also continued to use more than five years . Apple X has used for almost 4 years and is getting slower Mine also 4 years , except the battery life is getting worse , there is no problem with the fluency . Mine also the battery life only have about 70 , and then the game can not be played after changing a battery . When I play the game , it will be hot and stuck . Using 8P all the time , not stuck  very good You Apple 8P , have you upgraded the system recently?I am hesitant to upgrade , because I am afraid that the mobile phone will change to slow , please reply . It was update to 15.1 , no different from the original . Redmi , the system maintenance aspect , the realme system is not good . Redmi is relatively balanced in other aspects , and the system functionality is not as good as Redmi About system , can the MIUI beat color now?You are so funny  Doraemon is afraid  The functional aspects I am talking about . Talk about balabala function to me , there are many functions , but every day I encounter BUG , how can I experience anything ? Realme system is COLOR , why is it not better than the current MIUU MIUI is really not smooth now , but it is functional good The dark mode is too bad , and still not making progress . 13 probably will at the end of the year . First , the X70pp is 5499 is not 5999 , second , are you sure that a certain 12P 8  256 can be sold to 4499 ? You take the market price of the old machine compare to the release price of the new machine , then 12 series have no need to release . The market price of 11Pro was just over 3,000 , blood killed 12PRO  laughs without words  Mi 11U is completely beaten by X60Pro , you can imagine it . You can go to check the blind test scenes of major bloggers , 11U does not leak watermark never lost  AWSL  First , you compare the current price is really boring . Xiaomi 11Pro can still be 3099 now . Second , 12P 8  256 is not 4499 but almost the same . It can float up and down within 200 . After 3 days , you can turn over the comment screenshot and hit me in the face Sorry , Xiaomi s photograph was not worthy of comparing with vivo at all . Vivo s X50 series in the first half of last year was enough to beat all Xiaomi models . Laughing to death , the X50 series beat all models of Xiaomi , Who washed your brain Iqoo charging is stronger than Xiaomi . On the whole , it is Xiaomi . Everything else is similar . Iqoo is a game phone after all . Xiaomi 10pro is very surprising . Xiaomi 120W charging How many minutes of vivo to charge to full it showed before , I forgot . Fast charging part , OPPO , vivo is the leader . IQOO5 should not beat the M10 limited edition . IQOO should be a gaming phone . There is no attractiveness . The camera screen must not as good as m10 . IQOO seems to have only 4000 mAh , the battery life is not good Xiaomi Mi 9 users have the most right to speak hahaha Better than 120W charging On average , one grid of electricity will be lost in three minutes , You say the endurance is awesome ? Use 4S ? 13Pro My 13pro does nt lose one grid of electricity per 3 minutes , you are afraid of buying fakes It is exaggerated in 3 minutes , almost 5 minutes , keep the screen often bright , the brightness exceeds half At most four minutes , the brightness is not so high , and it s only opening a wechat alone Anyway , my mobile phone is almost that , and it is quite slow to drop from 100 . I just tried it , did nt drop any for 8 minutes . Useless , shut up 13Pro consumption is really so fast  Hum  is not just mine consume power that fast , okay ?  Hum  Why ca nt I speck ? I use this too . I can really last a whole day without playing games . It s way too much to say it lose 1  in 3 minutes Bro , have you used Note 10 Pro ? That screen is really too bad . The NEO5 vitality version  also LCD screen  , which is slightly more expensive than it , is much better Note 10 Pro screen is red and dark , no matter how to adjust it . I bought 10 for my family before , and the screen was indeed too bad . Finally , I returned it . to be honest , the stacking of models at this price is not as good as synthesize other aspects , plus MIUI bugs Do nt be more expensive than him . Note987 looks more comfortable than 10 The screen of the Note9Pro really looks more comfortable than 10Pro  Er Ha,I think the glory 50se LCD screen is relatively good , and the color authenticity and reduction are very good Agree , I also have compared before I changed 13pro now , and I did nt throw 6s away . I used them togetherLaughing Cry  I update 6s to the latest system , but it does nt get stuck at all . Some people say that we deceive ourselves , but if they do nt stuck , what else can I say ... Quite speechless Haha , if it were nt for the 6S I used before , I would believe itDOGE  I can only say , it depends on how to use it . Some play games all day long , even the most expensive and new mobile phone can be broken by him . Whatever , mine is still fine , totally did nt feel stuck . Is nt it normal that the mobile phone got stuck seven years ago ? Have feelings for a broken cell phone , right ? Do nt boast it anymore , it s just a phone It s really not stuck hahahaha . My sister lost her cell phone . Now take out my mother s 6p again , it is really good to use Indeed , I ve been using it for several years and it s been fine . Except for the battery that broke down a little before , I ve been using it very well since I replaced it . If it s not because I want to change a larger screen , I feel I can still use it for a long time Global 120 really is 120 at all times?Looking forward  I have used S20U before , really smooth except the camera interface Change Apple to S20U , do you recommend ?  Doge  It is not very recommended . 2K120 can not be opened at the same time . You can consider this year s S21U There are also blacklists , which are basically cameras and maps Mi Factory and Blue Factory do nt have to worry about this problem , they have their way Sony mobile phone fill the whole situation  Not simple   Not simple   Not simple  920 is not so bad , my mother s G90 T can still be used , do nt repeat word for word what others say My mother s CC9Pro , 730 G stuck seriously , It often crashes in daily use . Sometimes the camera turns on and turns black , and then directly prompts the camera for failure Really?Id love to use note7 change with her , my daily use is smooth Crawl away , That broken camera , as long as the lens has not been wiped with paper , probably the focus will be blurred My monitor s redmi note8pro is still working . He said it was enough . He just plays the Honor of Kings , does nt have much demand Yes , both Honor of Kings and PUBG can be played , different personal needs  not simple   not simple  , I think this phone is very good , 920 is higher than G90 T a lot  not simple  There is no productivity . Every day play Honor of Kings or PUBG , After that , browsing my microblog and video , chat or something . How good chip do I need ? My G90 T is still very durable , but the charging is slow , the photo is not good  Doge  Same feel . Mine is also charging slow , and photos are really bad . But it is enough to play Honor of Kings . It is still very comfortable to use at ordinary times . Yes , it s enough to play Honor of King , just wait Except for that one , it is really difficult to sell more if over 5 K  DOGE   Doge  Which one . h  doge   doge   doge  I really hope blue factory x can achieve high  end success . In those years , the x7 2499 experience was not bad . There was a fill light in front of the self timer , hifi when listening to songs , light touch , and good photography .Later , X20 21 was ugly , X70 seemed to bring back the reputation , and it is the perfect if 80 could be better 60 was relatively successful , 70 the initial pricing was outrageous , screwed up directly The point is that one s x  axis is not used for sale That one is not willing to use .  Laughing without words  So miserable to make money to research and develop , just gratitude  laughing without saying  Does Meizu have news ? Meizu machine has not been put on record yet , it is relatively late Will Meizu go directly to the Jidian version of Xiaolong  eat melon   DOGE   Doge  How can Meizu get the first  hand goods Meizu 18 , the appearance size configuration is very good , but small size , maintenance ca nt keep up , and after  sales is not good either . Small factories are too difficult nowDoge   Doge  Meizu s after  sales maintenance stores have all closed down , and there are no physical sales stores , so we have to turn to Mi The iterative is success , selling is victory  praise   doge   I have to say , now Meizu is a bit miserable  Kneel   The kerosene has already turned to Mi , ca nt hold this  Yun Bei  I m really not an apple fan , but the Apple system is not stuck , this is a fact . The Huawei I bought by my family was really good at first , but became slower and slower , and often downloaded the software by itself . However , the Apple 6s bought at the same time can still be used now . Although it is still slower than the new mobile phone , it is much better than the Android system . I just replaced Apple with Huawei . Please compare the price if you said it stuck . My friend s P30 has been bought for more than a year , I tried it before I buy the 40 , let alone the function , and the smoothness is quite good . It s time to change the concept of the early years Check it in a few years , it is not a problem with the mobile phone , it is the system , and the Android system has disadvantages Yes , I know what you said . However , the time of transit has moved , and the high  end machines of Android are really different . The system fluency is very stable . I did nt know until I bought it in recent years I have bought IP6 , IP7 , iPhone X and Xiaomi 2S , and the Xiaomi 2S of 2013 can still be used . The IP6 of 2014 since the second half of 2015 , the message function can not be opened . The 2016 IP7 has been stuck since 2018 , and I have never updated the system . If Apple wants to be smooth , do not update the system , and only two years can be used . It has no problem with Android for 3 years . MoreoverAndroid price is only Apple 12 The X from 3 years ago , aftre update to the latest 14.2 , it was smoother than the Mi 10 in my hand . It was no problem for Android to ues 3 years?You need to ensure that the Android system can be updated for 3 years . I use both , but Huawei is more smooth . Automatic downloading of software is a problem of native system How about MIX5 selfie function ? All chose to have under the screen , the selfie must be put aside  DOGE  In fact , the requirements are not too high , at least there must be a front  shot level of a non  selfie mobile phone of 1,000 yuan  DOGE  Plus the algorithm should have , mix4 is also close to  Doge   Very general  Laughing Cry   Laughing Cry  So the front camera like MIX4 , really suck This configuration seems higher than K50Pro K50Pro plastic middle frame and side fingerprints are the worst Is nt GT2PRO a plastic frame ? ? ? ? K50 Pro is Dimensity 8100  108MP HM2  67W5000mAh120Hz Samsung E4 flexible straight screen  Doge  You sure K50Pro is an E4 soft screen , not E4 hard screen ? Not sure Indeed , K50Pro was beaten , but last year , NEO2 was higher than K40 , too Then the sales volume is beaten , is it useful ? Why do nt you find more people to buy Realme and change yours by the way  Meow Meow   Hum  Does it matter sales are hot or not ? Do you buy a product or a sales volume ? The more Xiaomi sells , the happier you are , right ? Let you show me your Xiaomi stock ? Hope you are not a spiritual shareholder The first time to be the first . I do nt know what to talk about  DOGE  Find is just has a good screen , faster charging , nothing else , there is nothing to talk  Doge  Everyone has what you said , and do you guy find X5 pustule on the back There are no pustules on Small cup  DOGE  Broken , friends  smilefrom FindX2 standard version , equipped with Reno4Pro full set of the same camera  It s all tied up into a big fan DC s dimming will cause OLED change colors , which will make consumers who do not understand think that this screen is broken or a secondary product Have nt used Xiaomi 11 ? the screen of Xiaomi 11 series opens the DC lighting screen and will not happen color deviation at all So will the low brightness become blurred ? My mobile phone DC low brightness is directly blurred to death , the rag screen , the resolution feels lower than 720P Go to the physical store and see it , you will know . Xiaomi 11Pro s screen is the strongest in the domestic mobile phone this year , which is stronger than vivo E5 . Let s say that Xiaomi 11 does nt turn on DC strobe , it s basically invisible when taking photos with a mobile phone , which is better than Xiaomi 10 turning on DC . When DC is turned on , there is no strobe , and the screen is completely no color diviation . 2 K , 120 , DC are all turned on without conflict Handheld NEO5 tells you that this phone has DC dimming , but it does not hinder this screen is indeed a secondary product  Er Ha  neo5 is a fake DC So this switch is closed by default In this comparison , I suddenly felt that Mi 12 was more cost  effective  sad  , It costs more hundreds of yuan , better screens , better materials , symmetrical Harmancat , metal body , the system is much more better , let alone take pictures , not at a level  longing  The Moto brand is ruined by them Not only MOTO , ZUK , Le Meng , etc .  Doge  The two were not good originally , but the MOTO brand is still valuable Mi s Comparison method  Er Ha  Yes , use the Lei s comparison method , the motorcycle also lost . It s too funny . Haha , you ca nt learn the essence Indeed , many have not been written , and 12 this time , the small size , separate mold opening , internal stacking design and so on are all costs , which brings a good feel . The small screen flagship also caters to some small screen users . How can he compares , the positioning is different . His size should be compared with 12pro  doge  Yeah , I did nt want to see Apple instantly . Why ca nt Xiaomi be Xiaomi himself . Do not look at apples . That is very low In fact , it is best to use boiling text and patriotic marketing strategies on the mainland . This Huawei gains the most Have used itThe end is the same as Lenovo Boiling text marketing needs to be cheeky to cheat people in order to succeed This friend who uses K20 ? I feel Low is in your heart , not in your phone . The personal attack is quite skilled  As soon as the slogan of Xiaomi came out , it obviously deceived the domestic people who had not used iPhone . It is a very targeted marketing vocabulary , which naturally lowered its due market scope Cook once said that even his breathing was wrong . These distorted prejudices are still related to yourself unconfident . TPsychological distortion , no matter what people do is wrong . Can that Apple crap work ? Charging is slow , the signal is rotten , the heat dissipation is poor , the frequency is reduced , the store s cut is high , the penalty abroad is high , the system has a lot of bugs , the upgraded version becomes a nightmare , and the accessories are expensive . What else is there besides being safe and not stuck ? Servility ? stupid tax ? So my colleagues bought Huawei P20 and vowed to no longer buy Huawei , thetrue thing and the promoted Pro was completely two models  Yun Bei  In fact , many vivo series are top matched is the best . Iqoo8 is regular , similar to 7 . Iqoo8pro experience has been improved the most . Compared with last year s X60 , the top version of X70 series has good sincerity and configuration . The configuration is full and the shortcomings are correct . Findx2 was also a standard version last year , which was seriously separated from Pro experience publicity , unlike products of the same era . But this year , find X3 is sincere and has not weakened the camera . Last year s standard configuration took the poor imx586 as the main camera , which was really cross the line P20 and Pro are various reductions , including memory , cameras , and even workmanship , P waterproof , but not in the Standard Version , The publicity did not indicate that they used the p version to play us for a sucker The P50 Standard Edition has retained the IP68 level of waterproof and dustproof and the 66W fast charge , The gap of screen and photography is relatively acceptable It was originally two models . Essence Essence Huawei s differentiated treatment has been a tradition Mi 11 Pro and iPhone XS MAX double hold . I usually choose the iPhone when watching videos on Bilibili , it is more balanced  the podcast uses MI , and the human voice is more prominent . Personally , I think there is no one to beat anothor . Because the Mi 11P speaker is actually not very good I see . But at new year I m going to buy a bo A1 Gen2 as an output device hahahaha . It should be a lot better , I think . Yes , basically the Bluetooth speakers of more than 200 can beat the mobile phone The 11 series are all earphones with dual speakers , but they are all in the first tier . The 12 symmetrical ones are much stronger 10Pro  10s is much better than 11Pro , not the same level The first generation flagship of iqoo , which has been used for 950 days , is still smooth . It was replaced with an original battery for 69 yuan last month , and it is estimated that it can last for 2 more years . Like me , the iQOO first generation , the battery just changed last month , except for no 5 g , there is no reason to change your mobile phone at all . There is indeed no need to change . Three years?What was the first generation processor ? Snapdragon 855  Yun Bei   Yun Bei   Yun Bei  Ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , I m just worried about the poor localization of oneui , and I have nt dared to buy it    , My classmate s S21 feels great  What is localization ? That is , swiping domestic bus cards and other functions related to local life . Sony , which I used before , ca nt use many domestic app fingerprints  tears  Samsung has no problem in these part Do you know what localization means , which means that the system is bloated and full of useless push and functions . This is a common problem with domestic mobile phones . Localized Samsung and Apple is the same suck . The question is that oneui can be as smooth as iOS ? In the face of smooth and stable system , localization is nothing . It s clear to see that Apple s sales stock is so large Yes , stability is the most important  The quality of the Honor mobile phone is very good , 9X user is here Huawei Glory users always live in their own world , in Huawei s overpowering drug , in a brainwashed world , and ca nt get out . They ca nt see the truth , and ca nt be pulled out . Like cults , things that cut corners are said to be good Only Mi fan said glory cut corners . Watch the video of Xiaomi and glory TV dismantling . We can know who cut corners . Mi fans are too confidence . They do nt say that Mi cut corners , but say that glory cut corners . After dismantling the machine , They have nothing to say collectively . You were brainwashed too deep . Since you think Huawei s Honor s products are not bad , then explain to me why nova7pro and Nova8s e sell so expensive ? The chip is not good , the screen is not good , no NFC , no infrared , the motor is also a trash motor . I ask you , What are these things that are not e  waste or cheating ? Are these things just selling the brand ? There are good and bad ones , to be honest , 9X is a good mobile phone The screen that ca nt be seen under the sun , the glory habitually castrate screen Although the screen sucks , Tell a joke , the glory is quality The quality of glory is good or bad , Glory users have their own comments . Do nt BB if you have nt used it Stupid .  Laughing without saying  Boss Lei Xiaomi 12pro Game for peace need to adapt 90 frames Xiaomi 10U charging is intermittent , Xiaomi does not solve it ? Then you ask the after  sales for solution . Come here to call Lei Jun to repair ?  Doge  After  sales?Replace the mainboard of the mobile phone with another one , 3000 after warranty expires . No matter what kind of situation , it will seriously affect the second  hand price of mobile phones , and many people have the charging problems , and the situation is surprisingly consistent Play the Honor of Kings is a bit of drop frame and can not open the king s moment I always swipe right in the game and turn on performance mode , with an average of 113 frames I play Game for peace and feel that the performance mode is still a bit stuck , The ultimate mode is better . Ma HuatengMaHuateng Mi 12 Standard Edition takes photos is not as good as my k30pro K30P takes pictures really suck , focusing is too bad I was amused by you Almost enough . Only experience online . You know how embarrassing it is to scan the code for a long time and ca nt focusing Really ? Go to Xiaomi House for a try , but the 12 camera is still very strong The demo machine of Xiaomi home is good for taking photos The standard version is estimated to be the 582682 , the code scanning lens without optimization and OIS , and the pro may be 766 or 100 million  sad  Can it be compared with the image of x80pp ? Because compared with all aspects , x70pp is better than 11u . If it were nt for the 11u night owl being cut , there are really few comparable ones , let alone x70p . The night scene comparison between the first episode 11u night owl and x70p can be clearly seen Take GN2 compare with GN1 , seems the sam , shame on you  vomit  Why does nt blue factory use it if gn2 is so good ? JDont say in all aspects , only the photo experience . If you have to talk about professional photography and video quality , 11u has never lost Xiaomi s photos are even wrong in color . What can he compare with others?whee  The color is okay , and why are you very sure that the color is taken by the phone , not because of the different screens . But I do nt care very much about the color . I always match color again if I want to produce photos I do nt think so . 11U is stronger , The main camera is very strong . Periscope beat up the 800W periscope of Blue factory . Blue factory has Zeiss , with better color . There is a Portrait lens , with a transition The night scene is also X70Pro is stronger , right ? 11U . I do nt know why they weaken Night owl , before that , it is right awesome The positioning is different , the Xiaomi 10S configuration should be slightly better But the screen is not as good as K40 A straight screen , a curved surface , depending on personal preferences . I support the direct screen I also like straight screen , after all Samsung E4 120Hz , 10S Huaxing only 90Hz  Tears  I ca nt buy K40 , I hope scalpers ca nt sell any out  Mine have nt delivered the goods yet , I do nt want it anymore  Kneel  Where did you buy it ? Ca nt afford two mobile phones?I have Android and apple . Let s talk about the power first , and Apple will basically enter the shutdown state less than a day . Android in the evening still can have about forty left , and I have used this 12 for only 10 months . There are only 89 of batteries . My friend 12 months , battery 86 , the lock screen key is flaking paint . My XSM used for two years , At that time , the battery life was still 90 . Power?My 12PM played games and listened to the music browse Weibo , at least 40  of the electricity after a day , I did nt think the power was not enough  From 4S to 12 , only 6s and 12 make me think bad . 6S after sales does nt deal with the paint falling off the frame . 12 is some minor problems such as fast battery life loss It s hard to say , fortunately my power is very durable This person is so pitiful that the iPhone uses delusions Maybe the Huaqiang North version he bought Did you buy Android and apple at the same time ? Is the battery loss the same ? I ve just bought Android and it s v ery useful , but it s different after a long time . Now 13 just bought is a durable one . I switched one of my two Android phones back to iPhone now , which is still more comfortable to use iOS The battery loss of 12 is fast , and the power sucks . What else to boast ? I have used x for nearly two years , and I still have a health value of 87 . These 12 , 11 months , 89 health value . What do I boast ? 12 and 12PM is two different phone . how big the power is the 12 ? It s normal that your 12 suck . I just watch you boast Android here . It s the same with any battery that has been used for a long time Good guy , you are telling the truth  Er Ha  Looking at the Mi9 in my hand , I think about the words from Lei  Sure for a whole day  , almost the same  Doge  Mi 9  Yun Bei,I also used it . It s terrible to lose power . I play games and charge it n times a day Change the large battery 4000 . Some people say that Xiaomi can optimize the 5000 battery to 4000 . My 11u now have at least 6  7 hours of the screen on . As a result , the 4500 friend is this?Eat melon  1080  60Hz?I turn on the 2K120Hz bright screen and just about 4.5  5 hours My 11 battery health is still 70  , Turn on 2k120 , the screen still can hold for 5  6 hours When it was just released , I remember it was all about its good endurance  doge  how did it reverse now The Great God said that the fingerprint is not good , very slow and pressing more force than other Which one ? Is Datan good or the new GT neo2 ? I do nt know much about mobile phones  frown   grievance  I bought NEO2 , I m heavy game player does not like the curved screen Neo2 is said to lose power quickly even when it is standby . I do nt know if it s true I feel pretty durable , at least more durable than Iqoo5 I replaced Daily Master , Game NEO2  Two Ha  I take the dog head  laugh cry  Really , dog head only for polite datan is better at photography , GT NEO2 is more suitable for playing games a bit worried about endurance Do nt worry , of course screw up  Doge  Do nt worry about Samsung s battery life , it s never disappointed you  DOGE  haha Samsung s battery life , dddd iPhone13Pro supports 19 5 G frequency bands , but the signal performance is just fine Not ordinary , it quite sucks ... This generation is much better , at least there is almost no situation of scanning the code for payment , no network  DOGE  Holding 13pm  Single Dog  , There will be no Internet in all kinds of daily life scenes Cook  Amazing  Laughing Cry  More frequency bands do nt mean better signals . The foundation of a good signal is two points  one is to support more frequency bands , and the other is to have a better signal RF antenna .  What I got in my hand is Xiaomi MIX4 just released by Xiaomi . I got a shadow green gray version , Dangdang    Whoops , look at this green gray , it is like this , did you see it  DOGE   Do you see it ? hoho , wow  , this ceramic body texture is so good  White , I personally recommend this white most . Can you feel the gentle texture of this ceramics , white yyds .  Why your text has sound How to play without Internet enough , the signal is poor is true , but totally no signal situation ca nt happen once in several years 13 . Sometimes it s really no internet when it just come out from pocket  Yun Bei  From 6S to 13pm , I changed 5  6 mobile phones . I really have nt encountered it . Probably related to the location ? So jealous . Have you used 13PM What to jealous , the signal is really suck Why so many people say that the signal is bad . My signals are full .only me ? mystifying sarcastic Is your PM battery life strong ? I feel my power is not durable . When no APP is running , and the screen is locked , it will also lose power , dropped by one or two in 20 or 30 , and my 7P not . Would you like to tell the official ? My battery life is strong Exchange?Bitter  Waiting for more than half a month . But I feel a little disappointed , the battery is displayed  Update system Very durable . The battery life is stronger than 13P . just changed from 13P to 13PM , battery life is too strong Is it drop fast to play games ? I have always felt that my battery has a problem  bitter  I do nt play games , I have nt tested this aspect . relax , I use the realme , the system is real stuck after half a year , never care . Do you think OPPO is so conscience to give you a good mobile phone , is nt it just to seize the market and then grab the high price and harvest users Why do nt you say which model ? Even the most rubbish Realme is about 1,000 yuan , and It s rubbish to use for half a year then become stuck . The machine  sea tactics are determined that Realme is to cheat part of them . The flagships have no problem except expensive , this machine is all problem except cheap Realme has a hundred yuan machine . And 1000 redmi is also stuck . My friend is using it , and he did nt say anything . I have used OPPO s mobile phone before . The system is still very smooth OPPO and Realme system looks the same , but the latter is actually unstable  Surprise  Realm X has been used for two years and is still smooth . Do nt be ridiculous . The update frequency of realm system is really not as high as MIUI , but its stability is better than it Also x2pro , really suck GT2PRO battery life is very good , daily use is also smooth Can 618 drop to within 3000 ?  DOGE  Now the price in Pinduoduo has already be early 3,000s . 8  256 Wait for 618 , 12  256  doge   doge  Used for a month , and now the price is reduced by 300  Laughing CRY  Is nt it good to use ? If it was nt for my oneplus 8p breaking , I really do nt have the slightest desire to change it The price reduction is also quite fast  DOGE  Recommend a Android machine , make a backup , about 4000 . It takes 10 months to wait for 14 .  sad  IQOO9 . It looks good and good to use . Is nt this specialise in game ? I do nt really need a lot of game time . Now IQOO is not just a game console , there are good screens , good image systems , 120W fast charge , good  looking appearance . It is also good to use without playing games . As a user of Xiaomi Mi 6 change to Realme GT , it can only be said that the hope of domestic machines is sent to the Blue Factory.doge  I recently watched my friend change iqoo , I really want to change , too Do nt buy 8G1 and 888  doge  Others are optional I bought 12 from xsmax  hee hee  How does it feel , I am also holding xsmax and considering whether to change 12 I personally feel that there is nothing bad except for power consumption , after all , the battery capacity is limited After changing to 12 , do you feel that the signal has improved significantly ? This is what I care about the most , I never have any hope for the battery life of the iPhone Yo , just think the signal is not too good Mine is not a signal problem , but not enough memory  laugh cry  xsmax is still there , I mainly use 12 now , it is very light , I think it is very good to use  DOGE  I only used 48 G of my 256 G You are so patriotic , you should choose Huawei . The P30 is still so smooth now , and you can buy two for 4000 if you add some . ZTE , that s a miscellaneous brand , Wu Jing , that brand is deceiving people , they use Wu Jing s image at will . So do nt say that the elderly at home believe it , those friends who do nt understand mobile phones will also believe it . ZhongHuaKuLian , do you understand ?  Dizzy  Is nt this coaxing the elderly at home ? How do they know about the ZhongHuaKuLian ? They thought it meant that all the people of the People s Republic of China should unite together .  Laughing Cry  ZTE , Huawei , Coolpad , Lenovo  Halo  Tipical Huawei salesperson  ZTE s invitation to Wu Jing is nothing more than the patriotic idea of Wolf Warriors . Middle  aged and elderly people just like this . If you want to talk about patriotic marketing , who can compare to Huawei ? Do you think so ? Official announcement The official announcement is not important , the important thing is to persuade the family to not buy ZTE  DOGE   Doge   Doge  MIX4 was eliminated so soon ? MIX4 in addition to the screen camera is still a selling point , other configurations are not attractive  Doraemon is afraid  The whole ceramic feels good , I almost bought it , I went to see 12Pro two days ago , touched MIX4 , I almost did nt hold back MIX4 users tell you that the whole ceramic feels great , but without a mobile phone case , it lacks a sense of security , and it feels that it may not hold tightly at any time . It is said before that pork tenderloin is x70pp and mix4 ? What about X70P ?  sad  Ssame question  spread hands  Why do you say that only people who do nt know how to buy mobile phones buy OPPO vivo ? It s better to spend that money to buy a mobile phone such as Xiaomi . The price may be lower and the performance is better . By the way , the imaging processing chip of the mobile phone will also help a lot , so you ca nt just look at the pixels . emmm ... I do nt understand what is the use of mobile phone chips emmmmmm , then you can just find one that looks good  Yun Bei  Because it is true that the configuration is not enough for the price  sad  , but I buy a mobile phone just for it looks good ... The configuration is enough to use . In contrast , the appearance is more important ... Why do you have to complain that we buy blue and green ? emmm ... Anyway , I just need it to take pictures well  Sad  If you want to take a good  looking photo , the Xiaomi Mi 5x is the same . If you really want to take a photo , you can buy a Meitu , it can originally beautify , totally beat ov It s like you took the money to buy a Mercedes  Benz and ended up buying a BYD car . Nothing but looks can match its price . What is said is the group that always say something about stupid taxes Is nt Changxiang 20 an stupid tax ? Would you like to buy this ? Laughing to death , directly put you in that seat  doge  If there is no configuration , it has a textured appearance , which makes sense . I m not someone who only looks at configuration . If there is no appearance , workmanship and configuration , is nt it a stupid tax ? Directly pointing to Xiaomi phones Stupid tax groups and cost  effective groups are the same  laughs Cry  After sales should be better than Apple , what does you say about the green screen of apple now ? In terms of workmanship , look at the workmanship of this year s 13 . Many of the gaps are large on one side and small on the other , and the screen quality problems are uneven . I think Apple s workmanship is really not as good as those people say . how about burn wifi ? Burning WIFI they do nt replace it for you ? What about the Apple green screen problem ?  Eating melon  Apple official 14 days no reason to return Better after sales than Apple ? ? Just talking nonsense here ? Apple s official 14 days return without reason , do nt you know ? For other channel goods , this kind of workmanship problem , go to the offline authorization point to get an appraisal , and it is not troublesome to return it . As for Xiaomi , is there any after  sales service ? The problem of burning wifi , keep discussing , not admit it The point is that the same 11 pm is fine . Instead , 13pm as soon as the message came , there was no sound . 12 Also , there is always air in my corner of the film . I thought it was a problem with the tempered film at first , but it turned out to be the same after changing a few . Obviously , the phone screen is warped It is true , but Xiaomi Note 2.5D glass , Xiaomi 5 slender body ceramic , Xiaomi MIX screen ratio , bring out a lot of good  looking mobile phones . Fortunately , I have used Xiaomi 5 , which looks good , and feels really bad  dirt  so that I bought Meizu 16plus later , I always feel that Meizu is too fat . Many people say that Xiaomi lacks designers . In fact , I do nt think it is . Many of Xiaomi s design is still very advanced , and dare to try new materials . What Xiaomi lacks is the spirit of craftsmen . Xiaomi dares to take the lead in the world , but this maybe go too fast , causes the design to have a feeling of being thought of in an instant . In other words , there is no serious polishing and precipitated ideas , or it can be said to lack the spirit of craftsmen . After comparing friend businessmen s dare to be late of the world , it is very good , all of them have their own audience ? Is nt Xiaomi Note2 a 4  curved surface ? What he said should be  Xiaomi Note 2.5D glass  Er Ha   Er Ha   Er Ha  Actually , you forgot Xiaomi Note2  Er Ha   Er Ha   Er Ha  Some people are so sour . After all , many digital bloggers and their studio practitioners use iPhones as the main force . These people do nt pay attention to fast charging , and they do nt pay attention to signals . I am selling iphone , Aishide authorized store  Apple s official website can be checked  . I am often asked to return the goods by customers because of the poor signal , and I am also scolded  You ca nt say that most of the people who use Apple are stupid , just a little stubborn , and there are many people who think that 5W chargers are better than fast charging . There are also people who are afraid of explosion because the ipad charging fast charger is too hot to ask for a return  Change career already  eat melon  It is indeed worse than Android , this is no problem Compared with Huawei , it is really bad . After all , base station is what Huawei does , but the signal of Xiaomi is not much better . I think the signal of Xiaomi and Apple are similar . I have never used other Androids , so I do nt know . Are you a student ? After go to work , you will find that long battery life is more useful than fast charging . Yes , every time I go out to run a project , it takes one day to explore . If the battery life is short , it ca nt stand it at all . Indeed , these KOLs use money to tout other products , and then look at their Weibo , all of them are honestly using iPhone s , as expected , they are doing business on the surface , but privately they have their own ideas . The big battery is the king , the real man never cares for weight  doge  Brick for you Xiaomi 10 thick 10 mm does not affect Xiaomi 10 thick 8.96 , thiner than 9 mm  eat melon  But if you care about thickness , it is really a disaster for bare mechine more than 9 mm and plus the mobile phone case . After I bought the Xiaomi Mi 10 , I felt disgusted about the feel so I returned it . I bought the 12 , only the screen was a bit suck , and then I bought one at the price of the 10s . . Also bring a silicone phone case thickened by a third . . It feels quite light and thin , and it feels better than the 12 . . I did nt buy 10U because it was too thick . The thickness of 11u is really comfortable . It does nt matter if it s heavy . If it s thick , I do nt even consider it 1 Back then , they criticized the 865 s plug  in baseband  doge  , but it did nt make any difference for use . The iPhone has always been plug  in , and it s not as bad as they said . Yes , it has , open 5 g or not make 865 and a15 two different chips  Yun Bei   Yun Bei  it was not the same chip , one is a few years ago , another is A15 I mean these two chips are both facing this embarrassment Apple s plug  in baseband is really suck  Yun Bei  Accidentally no signal There is not much relationship between power consumption and signal Does Apple s network not suck ?  Laughing Cry  No matter how bad it is , there will not be much difference in urban areas , county towns , and small towns . Only in places such as basements , the signal is really poor , but the operator is still the main responsibility . As a Mi fan for many years , I would say that oppo is indeed better than Xiaomi , in terms of light ratio . Xiaomi s slender external screen makes people just want to open it to use , but opened is 60hz , with a strong sense of splitting and large creases . The ratio of oppo seems to be the best at present , and it can be held in one hand . If you want to be big , open it , if you want to be small , you can use the out screen . Xiaomi is very embarrassed , and the appearance is not good . Even in terms of publicity , oppo is a peacock as soon as it unfolds , which is very beautiful . Xiaomi is a fish after unfolding What is there to boast about the one  to  one internal screen ? When watching videos , the display area is not as good as that of mainstream Android phones It looks comfortable and feels good to hold . The Mi fold is so long , like a remote control , and the display area is also very awkward . It s too ugly to take it out . Will you watch videos on the outside screen ? ? ? If there is a folding screen , you do nt use the inner screen to watch the video , then why do you buy a folding screen Android tablet ecological adaptation is very poor , only this 11 , I hope oppo can give developers the money spent on marketing . Only rely on yourself to fight Huawei , Xiaomi , Samsung , Lenovo and other software ecosystems . ?  Yun Bei   Yun Bei   Yun Bei  Just boasting  Switting   Switting   Swinding  Then you buy Mi fold , see if you are comfortable with it Taking pictures , if it is a product of the same parallel generation , Samsung flagship  Huawei without sanctions  Apple ProMax  Huawei with sanctions  full of Xiaomi  OPPO flagship  vivo flagship  Meizu flagship  OnePlus flagship , How about it . Xiaomi does nt have to be parallel to ov  allow sadness  , it is obviously stronger than blue  green Where does the confidence come from to say it is obviously stronger than  Cracked  I do nt think you need to argue with me with an Iqoo  Rabbit  Think too highly of Apple and Samsung s photos ? Apple has a good experience in taking pictures and videos , but it is actually no better than domestic photography . Samsung is the same . Samsung ca nt be the best now . Samsung is actually good , many samples can hit the x70 on the ground  you get what you pay for take a part of the whole This is the way it is , Xiaomi s experience quality and workmanship are completely incomparable nonsense Do nt buy Xiaomi I used it for two years from 2015 , and I have nt used Xiaomi since 2017 Black is better . Ask for another thing , I m in a hurry to change my phone , I do nt play games , and I have requirements for taking pictures . Which one do you recommend to buy now , Xiaomi Mi 12 and find x3 ? I like the feel and appearance of the Xiaomi Mi 12 . I do nt know how much worse the screen and camera are than the x3 , the difference in daily use is big or not . Are there any other mobile phones below 4000 recommended ?  not considering realme   Laughing Cry   Laughing Cry  12 s screens are much better than X3 . E5 material , the main camera is also strong The e5 is 12pro . The Huaxing 1080 screen used by the Xiaomi Mi 12 is definitely worse than the x3 , and the x3 766 dual main camera should be better than the Xiaomi Mi 12 . Is nt the main camera of 12 is used for the 12pro ?  laughs cry  In x3 and 12 , I recommend 12 , but you still have to touch it offline . After you get started , you will naturally know which one is right for you . The screen of the 12 is really good . I have always used the full set of Apple . I was pleasantly surprised to see the screen of the 12 . I know that the iPhone is the worst mobile phone at present , with slow charging , poor signal , mediocre photography , poor system experience ... Still want to buy  halo  Come and persuade me  So expensive to buy a machine that ca nt even have a good phone signal ? how embarrassing Old problem , never solved So do nt buy it So rich that can do anything I did nt buy any large digital products in February , I always felt a little less  Laughing Cry  Continue in March  Laughing Cry  Really , after using the note , which is s22u , ca nt go back to any other brand of machine . The Samsung system is still a little worse . I gave up before because I could nt accept that the notification bar information could nt be folded . When I opened it , it was full of messages from an app , and I slid a whole page for a long time . I feel that Samsung is an enjoyment  level experience because of the Samsung system no1 , oneui function and humanization , appearance , high brush , and basically no advertisements . Each drop  down notification center has a secondary menu , and I feel that I ca nt go back . Since you raised the topic to support domestic production . Should we also consider the possibility that the U.S. s extreme sanctions and long  arm jurisdiction have led to Huawei s use of foreign components  including but not limited to Samsung screens  , and there is a possibility that the supply will be completely cut off ? The Black Shark 3 series uses the top domestic screen BOE Forget it , the video mentioned that the Black Shark 3 is not good . . . Do nt whitewash it , do you have time to look at other reviews ? Are you staring at only one ? Now that you talk about supporting domestic production , you use such a rubbish screen , and it still sell for 4,000 yuan . There are so many state  owned enterprises , Xiaomi OPPOvivo , any one is better than yours , why do nt I support domestic production that is stronger than you ? Where is Xiaomi s Huaxing Optoelectronics screen good ? First , the Mi Pro is a Samsung screen . Even if the Xiaomi Mi 10 is replaced by Huaxing Optoelectronics , it seems that it will not be worse than this  too happy  Second , this Weibo is about the Honor 30Pro . Now , if the Xiaomi Mi 10 is really bad after replacing Huaxing Optoelectronics , there will naturally be an evaluation to say it , so what are you talking about ?  Unintelligible  Let s learn about Black Shark . It supports domestic production , but it s a bit unreasonable to use two screens with very different specifications for the same mobile phone ? Here , Huawei did not tell users about this  doge  Obviously , this video says that the screen of Black Shark 3 is not good But you can rest assured that it is better than the Honor 30pro  two ha  iPhone s batteries have always been poor . I agree that it was not good before , but you should use the one after to find out . It is really bad . I have used it all the way from 6 , and there is no time when it is not bad . Apple s battery life is not good , not just blowing . It s like if I use xsmax without playing games , I can be beaten by fold2 of playing games , you say it s not bad . It has gradually improved since 11 , not to mention the 13 super cup Check out the reviews ? ?  Smiles  34000mAh Apple and 45000mAh Android are heavily used , Android battery life is not as good as Apple , I wonder if you have seen it ? It s right that was not good before , but it s different after 13 . 13 has 400 mAh more power than 13pro , but the pro s battery life is 40 minutes longer than 13 . Because of the addition of adaptive high brush and optimization , it saves more power , while max saves more power . I m not interested in evaluation , it s all about taking money to do things . It means nothing without a large number of user usage data . After a period of time , the real usage data of users will come out and than you can say it is better than Android . Is even such a logical and rigorous science and engineering man as Brother Hua impulsive ? This product is mean to be backup machine , do nt you think that it could never be the main machine with the poor battery life ? ? ? ? Not everyone is an Internet addiction boy like you This stupid dog was said to be unreasonable , so he blocked me . lol Hahahahaha , he ca nt afford it , most of the people who spray apples are this mentality  Doge  According to you , neither the iPhone8 and the previous series can be used as the main machine Why do nt you have any knowledge of mobile phones ? ? ? ? The iphone8 does not have a 5 g and a large screen , so the power consumption is not so large , so the battery life is not so bad . The large screen and 5 g of the 13mini run out of power in minutes I have bought 12mini and 13mini , as well as iPhone SE2 and iPhone 7 and 8 . To be responsible , when 5 G mode is turned on , 13  12mini can be used normally for a day . The battery life of iPhone 8 can not be compared to that of 13 mini . It s not someone else but you have no common sense . Do nt be a keyboard warrior . Say anything after you buy it and use it , do you only read the data on paper ? People who mainly use the 12mini pass by  doge  , and now the 13 is used as the main mini backup . I heard that the battery life of the 13mini is better . Of course you can if you do nt watch videos , play games , or use it heavily . But most people ca nt Originally when 10P was released , it was very good to take pictures . In the past , there was an automatic fusion night scene algorithm for shooting night scenes , and the highlights were well suppressed . Now it is not as good as the previous night scenes , and the highlights are not as good as before . Regardless of the performance of 10u , photography and fast charging have been cut , and it is not as good as before . I believe that the photo and fast charging have been cut . Are you sure that the performance has been cut , either ? Xiaomi is now up to 11u and down to the thousand yuan machine , is all not as good as other manufacturers  . My previous k30s 865 , playing the King of Glory could nt even stabilize at 60 frames . Since the 11 standard version burned wifi , the system has been updated fearfully I have never heard of K30s unstabled I am a 10U user , I agree with you very much , my MIUI stable version often restart automatically Now Xiaomi s mobile phone is worse than other mobile phones with the same processor . Since 11 burns the motherboard and burns the wifi , each model does not dare to schedule at will after the system is updated . That s right , Xiaomi Mi 11 burns , what does it have to do with my 10U , it affects me Is Xiaomi sure it is ne g ative optimization ? The effect of 11u Ye Xiao is also much weaker . Who wants to buy Xiaomi in the future ? Xiaomi s negative optimization is more serious than other manufacturers . At that time , the k30 s first 686 camera image was very good . In the 10 series , the hmx sensor was used , but the photos were difficult to describe . Later , a good camera algorith m has not been released for so long , and the 10p symmetrical dual speakers It s pretty good , but it was weakened later , and then 10u and 10s also cut the vibration But Apple is also stuck . My ipadmini5 often gets stuck , I think Android is better to use agree . I often get stuck at my 13pm , not much better than Android 12 pm agree . It s no different from more than 3,000 yuan Android phones , and it s even slow to charge  doge  What is the configuration of mini5 ? What year is the machine ? Got water in your head ? I m talking about when I just bought it It s time to switch to the M1 version of the pro If it is 3699 , it is really better to buy 18p . The only thing that Meizu worries me about is battery life . The real experience and the occasional Meizu data that occasionally appeared during the evaluation of various media tells you that what Meizu is the least worry about is the battery life ? I am a Meizu user It can only be said that under the same battery size , others  battery life is not stronger than Meizu . The starting user of 16s replied to you that the battery of more than 3000 is completely sufficient , but the fast charge is not very good  doge  Mine is also a 16s , and I have never used a faster one , so this fast charge feels okay , and I am not in a hurry . It s been more than two years , and the battery life is dead . wait 19 16s I feel okay Reno7 is all Dimensity 2000 ? Can it beat the 870 of Reno6pp ? You fake fan , the configuration parameters have been sent out before Haha , it seems 6pp yyds Nothing yyds  The 6pp heat dissipation is particularly bad . I have bought it , and the hottest 870 is not excessive . The Reno7Pro is almost the same as the OnePlus 9rt , and the heat dissipation is much stronger . As long as the Dimensity 2000 is cooler than the 888 , it is still the flagship direct  screen flagship with differentiated positioning . 900  778  1200  No oversized cup , 6pp yyds No , 7Pro is Dimensity 1200 , 7 is Snapdragon 778 You know so much In addition to Huawei , domestic mobile phones with a price of more than 5,000 have very few sales .  Allow sad  all of them keep rushing to high  end  Allow sad  And then ... then consumers do nt buy it . Why does Huawei sell well over 5k ? Because under 5k is basically a suck phone It ca nt be said that , high  end success is that someone is willing to pay for its premium . For example , Apple has poor signal , small battery , slow charging , and poor Selfie . It can be said that Apple is not as good as Android except for the processor and system and record video , but it is Apple . Most people feel that holding an Apple can can show off , and Huawei is the same . When other people hear it , you have a Huawei mobile phone , wow ...  allow sadness   allow sadness   allow sadness  999 is also a Huawei mobile phone , and 9999 is also a Huawei mobile phone . Others envy you , but it s not uncomfortable for you to use it yourself ? Six thousand p40Pro , not even dual speakers Huawei is just catching up with the good time . Others have a configuration of 5,000 yuan . It sells for 7,000 or 8,000 yuan . The high  end in the eyes of the rich is high price . you re right I personally feel that the most difficult thing to hit the high  end is to change the stereotypes of consumers and gain consumer recognition . You do not have enough strength to change the stereotypes in the market . For example , a young man riding a ghost fire calls himself a multi  millionaire in the village every day . Other people s stereotype of him is that he is poor ... I think it s mainly the chip screw up , is nt 888 and 8gen1 compared to A15 is industrial garbage . The Android system will not stuck after three years of use , but it will heat up and drop frames when playing games Why is it almost impossible to see the heat and battery life of iQOO9 measured by the media ? The same question The heat dissipation of iQOO9 is so strong , they do not evaluate it , they are speechless Because the frame rate is too bad  DOGE  Because there will be fools who think that the untested is the best , and then buy it Indeed , only a fool would buy the 888plus Black Shark 4s  laugh ha ha  Because the machine that the media got before , the software has not been adapted properly , it is just a semi  finished product  laughs without saying a word  , as Xiaobai said in the video before , iqoo has a software team that has been isolated I see Trust from 1  7p , 1  9p still supports it without hesitation , it brings disappointment , nothing else Brother , what s wrong with OnePlus 9Pro ? My Oneplus 7Pro is planning to change to 9 Battery life too sucks Is the battery life bad , bro , just use it normally Hahahahahahahahahahaha nothing else Disappointed with OnePlus are all regular OnePlus users 11pro is really strong if it does nt burn wifi and it change the rear module miui s camera optimization is far worse than coloros How much is the difference ? Nonsense  digging nose  Xiaomi 11Pro is the first echelon no matter how bad it is , and it is better than OnePlus no matter what . The camera of MIUI starts to freeze , which is also the problem of frame drop caused by MIUI12 . MIUI13 solves these problems . But at the image algorith m level , OnePlus is the worst . The parent company s taking pictures ca nt win the grain factory , it s useless to count on the younger brother . Oppo algorith m can not compare with miui , you really dare to say 11P does not burn , only 11 burned No , my friend s 11U burned , all changed new 11pro says it needs to be burned three times before replacing The wifi burner is 11 . 11Pro also burned , I am one of the victims AYun , will Apple 14 have fast charging , should I buy 13p now ? At present , it may be the C port , and the charging power will increase , but the 13p has more than 23w , and it feels okay . It seems unlikely that the C port  allowing sadness  , after all , the L port is also a large amount of income . However , I am looking forward to the C port . I hope that the charging port can be unified as soon as possible . Their own products are not unified . 23w charging is really not good , although it is already okay , but it has to work harder , let alone 100 watts , half of it will do  allow sad  Looking forward to slap in the face No , expect Apple to make fast charging , it is better to expect the sow to go on the tree  decline  what can be upgraded with 14 ? this right  angle mold has only two generations , it will definitely not be replaced , and the bangs will not be replaced , nor will the punching be changed . The high brush is already there , and the lens has nothing to change , it is already very strong PRO upgrade the 48MP camera and dig holes . 14 cut off the mini and add MAX , and then standard equip A16 processor . Then sell for another year , Android does nt work at all , Apple does nt need to improve too much to stay undefeated Personally , I am using 13pm , I feel this battery life , it does nt matter if there is a fast charge  allow sad  I am using mix4 now , 120 fast charging is really cool , it is basically full in a few minutes , and there is also a 100w fast charging in the car , if it is not because the Android carlife is too suck , I can still wait for 14  allow sad  It depends on whether the car has CARPLAY pre  installed . Can k50pro defeat fixdxpro Dimensity in addition to taking pictures  doge  System fluency and stability do a good job and then win  The quality of workmanship is estimated to be inferior to the green factory , and may be the only high thing is price  allow sad  OPPO system fluency is not good  Yun Bei  Really just talk online  longing  Brother , what are you thinking ? How is this possible , the price of the two is there , and the green factory is its own flagship , to compare it with the redmi that has always been bad at taking pictures  angry  So I said except taking pictures  Doge  Ca nt beat it , next  doge  , today I saw a disassembly diagram of OPPO s 766 with suspension and anti  shake . The volume is larger than gn2 , but the bottom is a little smaller . In a blogger called the technology circle , I do nt know where the pictures came from .  laugh cry  , it may be that the manufacturer released it in advance to warm up . OPPO find X3 is definitely a mobile phone that will surprise you , and the offline 3199 also gives you cooking oil  allow sad  Except for the battery life , the x3 is basically perfect , and now the experience and texture are absolutely invincible in the price range of 3000 The z  axis motor is also a small problem . Well , it is , but the parents should not care about this point  DOGE  , anyway , my parents are like this , and it is the flagship of the year . Even if the Z axis should be optimized better My brother  in  law 3200 replaced to Reno7 , After I found out , the blood pressure came up  crack   crack   crack  , but I ca nt help it after he has bought it  crackcrackcrack  In fact , I have 4000 , I will change to Reno7Pro , not everyone likes cost  effectiveness . I think it looks good , feels good , and the processor is enough , that is fine . 4000 778 G , that s not cost  effective , that is cheating consumer . Where can you tell me in detail ? I do nt see how the battery life is going . Although the 870 is not that hot . The battery life seems to be the same as the Mi 11 . Screen , feel texture , charging , balanced performance power consumption At this price , I think it is better to buy Xiaomi Mi 11 . Then the market feedback under the screen is actually so so , and the products with lower positioning prepared by the grain factory have been postponed or killed . . . In fact , I think the pop  up camera of the K30ULTRA is pretty good , except for the processor and the resulting power consumption . Power consumption is fine , mainly takes up too much internal space  DOGE  bro yours is k30s , mine is k30u , the battery life is really poor , charging twice a day is not enough It is a person who can only speak on the Internet . In reality , there are a few real users who can be so idle that they are confused about whether the screen is punched or off the screen .  laughs haha  No , there is a basic function problem here . The daily public will not pursue complex functions and hardware , but the effect of basic video calls must be guaranteed . Nowadays , online WeChat video calls between family members , video conferences at work , and socializing are all too important , but the front camera screen is currently far from being able to do it , especially outdoors , when the light is not good , it is equivalent to losing its effect . People obviously ca nt accept it The performance is not good , it can only be compensated by differentiation  doge  If you put it in the price range of Redmi Note , or even lower , the feedback will not be ordinary  meow  A lot of people who do nt understand digital almost never wipe the camera , plus the front camera is relatively blurry  two ha  Besides , the sales of the more powerful Note10 are still not as good as the Note9 and Note11 . D ont believe OnePlus The 9pro has a maximum battery life of 4.5 hours . As 13pm , none of Android is enough to hit  doge  I bought 7tp 8p 9p , but I do nt plan to support it this time . If the 9pro does not turn on 5 g , it is still very simple to keep the screen on for 5 hours .  Spring Tour Family  I also bought three generations . Let s see the evaluation this year  Erha   Yun Sad  If the Android phone does not turn on 5 G , I feel like I bought it for nothing . I turned off 5 g when it was hot at 12 pm , and the 13pro turns on 5 g throughout the whole process , and the battery life is better  call  I ca nt believe in Oneplus  system update , I believe in everything else  Spring Tour Family  OPPO and realme , the system updates ? No , frame drop and downscaling are the same It is only said that the chip A series is really a god on mobile phones , even if the frame drops and the screen is locked , it is not a problem of the chip . It s that the mobile phone ca nt play its strength It can really be touted . Is it that the mobile phone is not good to equipped a chip ? iPhone mobile phone really ca nt play , you will understand if you change the tablet I m in Guangdong , Guangzhou , I m playing PUBG at this temperature , no matter how I use it , I have nt lowered it , and the high  definition image quality is extreme . Holding the Redmi K30Pro and the Apple 11 , Apple is ok in daily use . Almost every game in the game will heat up and drop frames , and even freeze . Apple has an advantage in the smoothness of animations . Other experience is not as good as Android a few years ago , I would rather use Xiaomi with more bugs than Apple with bad experience . I have nt really encountered the situation of stuttering , heat , and dropped frames . I used Xiaomi 11 for more than a month and sold it . How bad is it ? I have also used the Redmi K20 pro . Xiaomi , that refresh rate is the same as those of Iqoo . My current refresh rate is basically the overall situation . Although it is not full , it is smooth , comfortable to use , and good battery life , although the charging is a little slow . Now Apple is nothing but smooth system animations I am using the 11pro now , the last one was the xs , the last last one was the xr , I feel that the 11pro has a slightly stronger battery life than the xr , completely defeating the xs , and this one has been used for a year and a half and the battery is still 98  healthy , very durable . In addition , I also ordered a 13pro 256 G , and I went to the direct sales store on the 25th to pick it up . I do nt have high requirements for the battery life of the 13pro . It is enough to reach the level of 11pro or xr , but not the level of xs , it will be too bad I use 12 pm , even with 5 g on , I do nt think it s as good as 11pro At 12 pm , the battery life of 5 G is not that good , and it is much more stable if you switch to 4G. Yes , but when I do nt turn on 5 G , I feel like I bought the phone in vain . When Weibo loads the original image , it is obviously still 5 g faster , and 4 g has to wait for loading How much is the difference between 11Pro and 13Pro battery life  DOGE  Let me put it this way , since switching to the 13pro , the infinite charging pad on my desk has not been used , completely , because it is useless at all . I go to work from 900 to 500 pm , and I do not charge during this period , and my remaining battery has never been lower than 40  . The battery life of this generation is very reassuring Awesome , I remember 11p is very small Yes , it is very small , the same size as the xs , with a 5.8  inch screen , but the battery is very durable . The main point is that the thickness is about 0.4 mm thicker than the xs , and the weight is also more than ten grams . These sacrifices are to enhance the battery life . Of course , in the end The result is also very good How about the vivo z1 , I want to buy it for my mother Do nt buy OV , you should pay more attention to the cost  effectiveness when buying for your family , so you can buy Xiaomi 8SE The se screen is too small , and the fuselage is too square , I feel it is not suitable for mothers , to be honest , ov is more suitable for elders ov bells and whistles are really not suitable for the elderly 660 processor , it is better to buy Xiaomi 6x , stay away from blue  green factory Is it the world s first plastic back in 2018 ?  two ha  There are more Xiaomi than OV over 4000yuan , and more OV in 2000  3000yuan . Are you kidding me , what is the comparison of x60 X i aomi ? With the mix 11u these things ? ? What else does the X60 have besides images ? Charging screen single lift rotor motor It feels great in the hand , I feel it is the most comfortable phone in my hand this year Yeah ? You look at the detailed data of each price segment  laugh cry   crack  There are more of blue factory s in 3000 to 4000 , under 3000 , generally the middle end Below 2000 , do you have a good hand feel , preferably a curved screen , I want to buy one as a spare phone Realme gt master exploration version , the surface has grades , processor , camera , charging , impeccable , 2000  , if you buy a surface below 2000 , you should go and see the secondhand  doge  thanks One plus 8 feels good  Spring Tour Family  thanks . OnePlus 8 , good feel , high face value , the most important is the system is light and easy to use thanks The Mi 11 is really crap , I have never been so disappointed by a phone . regret buying it From Honor V10  Doge  As far as battery life is concerned , it is not as good as the V10 that I have used for three years . The keyboard is almost broken Really shameful , Honor V10 Get out From Honor V10 ?  DOGE   Mine is also Honor , just ask  Yes , my previous phone is V10 Even Note9 Pro is better than it  doge   doge   doge  Forget about note9pro , it ca nt compare ... Although I am a Mi fan . But the 750 G is a lot worse than the 778 G , and the screen of the note9pro is not yet wide color gamut ... The note9Pro has 100 million pixels . The most important thing is to take good photos at this price . However , the note9Pro is still the machine at this time last year . If you think about it carefully , it is not as good as this , how uninteresting it is . Is 100 million pixels very good ? Apple s main camera is 12 million , is nt it still good ? It depends on the tuning and the sensor  dig nose  Wrong , note7PRO wins it Note9pro ca nt be compared , Snapdragon 750 g is one grade lower than 765 g , not as good as 778 g at all I asked you to buy iq8p , you do nt buy it , now you do nt have phone to use nowtwo hatwo ha  The iQOO 8 Pro is too different f rom the Vivo X70 Pro , so there is no way to buy the two phones No mobile phone is perfect Hmm , so I am waiting Xiaomi was eaten by you ? I do nt like Xiaomi , k40 g and miui12.5 hurt me too deeply Why do we need to rely on foreign evaluations to prove us , not to mention the iPhone s catastrophic ghosting , ultra  low tolerance of night scenes , and lack of night vision video . It is estimated that it will not be long before the domestic big V release the evaluation of the X70 super cup defeating the iPhone to take pictures . The night scene of the camera is poor , this is indeed the iPhone is behind . But is this point of the night vision video a joke ? Apple does not have the ability of night vision , and vivo can open super night scene video alone . Vivo s default mode is as bright as Apple  s. The super night scene can only be 1080P30 frames , and the picture almost ca nt watch , what s the use ? Just like the new iPhone s movie mode , it s just a show Can the video level of the x70 beat the iPhone ? Funny ? And go to see the photo experience of the x70 , what are you saying here ? Apple s ghost shadow should indeed be optimized  Good  Apple s system is smooth and the performance is excessive , no matter how strong the performance is , it will still heat up Still saying heat?have you used it ? What mobile phone is not hot ? Ask for inform My phone is not hot , the frequency is locked  doge  Get out if you do nt say it s hot , mine is hot even just charge  too happy   too happy  The latest 13 ? Now the 13 generation charging is not hot . Sometimes the charging is not hot , and sometimes it is extremely hot . It is also easy to get hot when you open 5 G outdoors . My friend is holding an Apple 12promax . He originally wanted to pay more to change 13pm . After I recommended the Black Shark Magnetic Cooling Back Clip , he saved money  dogedogedoge  Is the effect good ? He usually play the glory of the king . it will never heat up and drop frames with the back clip on . If he do nt wear headphones when he open the voice , he will occasionally hear the noise of the propeller . And this one needs to be plugged in another line , which is more troublesome when going out . Great to play at home . Because Apple is usually fine to play , but often has to play while charging , and it gets hot and stuck when charging . But K40 is too slow to charge Less money and more things , ca nt you consider Xiaomi or Black Shark ? There is really nothing that can be bought , 11 burn , the target group of black shark appearance is the game party Except for the first batch , 11 seems to have not been burned , and only 100 people have burned in hundreds of thousands of sales , which can only mean that they are unlucky  cute  Black Shark  Doge  Thick , no infrared , after all , gaming phone Then Mi 11ultra , there is nothing that ca nt be solved by adding money  doge  Black Shark 4 , Black Shark 4S , MIX4 Ca nt ? Only for the k40 model , because at that time it was a mobile phone under 3,000 in my list to buy in the same period Do nt they just want to use the telephoto as the selling point of the top flagship ?  Laughs haha  Saying that the usage rate is not high . Reasonable castration It is true that the usage rate is not high , and Huawei made the telephoto only to meet the photo needs of some middle  aged people . There are also many young people around me who use telephoto . On the contrary , many middle  aged people ca nt even tell the difference between telephoto and ultra  wide  many of my relatives ca nt tell the difference   doge  Of course , this is all around me human data . To be honest , for a flagship machine , both telephoto and ultra  wide  angle are indispensable . Apple s telephoto ca nt work , this has long been determined , and now Android s telephoto ca nt work , that is ,  the frequency of use is not high   doge  Make sense The low usage rate is really nonsense . I think I often use three to five times the light change , but at the beginning of this year , except for the OnePlus 10PRO , the rest have been cancelled , reverse upgrade  doge  Haha , that s . If you really feel the utilization rate is not high , do nt bring it anymore Brick ? How many ? you say , it is still a brick If it s not a brick , it ca nt hold 8 . E  sports brick  Doge  This is a little heavier than the k40 e  sports version . I feel uncomfortable with the weight of the k40 For the heat of the Snapdragon 8 , sacrifice weight  doge  normal Anyway , it is much better than the green factory , and it may be inferior to Huawei Xiaomi  Thinking   Thinking   Thinking  Blue Factory s super  sized cup I personally think it s the best to take pictures The high light suppression of the blue factory is good , but the telephoto is not very good  Erha  Add the t  coating and Zeiss to the 11u module and then upgrade the ultra  wide angle is the best  doge  Do you think that Zeiss will let a manufacturer with poor image algorithm tuning join him to smash his signboard ? The earliest Nokia will not be worse than Xiaomi . Xiaomi  Xiaomi flagship takes good pictures The accumulation of hardware , algorithm photography is the most important Xiaomi is the accumulation of hardware , in fact , the tuning is very poor Yes Yes Yes . The tuning is very poor , and the blind evaluation has never been lost.spread the hand  Indeed , it has never won actually  Doge  Except for the z  axis motor , the battery life is not good , there is no DC , and the x3 looks like Apple , everything else is very good The telephoto is made up , and the short  focus fingerprint can also be called good ? It seems that there are more and more shortcomings , the z  axis motor , the battery life is not good , there is no DC , it looks like apple , there is no 12 G storage , the long focus makes up the number , the short focus fingerprint , help  allow sadallow sad   allow sad  The main camera algorith m is average , the same 766 , Huawei iQOO is better than the green , the custom cmos tuning is not as good as others , confusing The X3 battery life is not good ? The screen can be bright for 7 hours , you still say the battery life is not good . What do you want ? Bright screen for 7 hours , wow , I believe it  doge  Under cos12 , the battery life of OPPO s machines is exceptionally good , provided you upgrade to cos12 first X3 kills the background is very serious , only 8 g ca nt hold it Yes , yes , and there is no 12 G storage , fatal defects Indeed no 12 G Is nt the front of yours 18 series ? Sorry for senting out 19 I do nt expect 19 , I expect 22 , my first Meizu is 16SP , and it is still very smooth to use now , but there are a lot of advertisements , this year I bought 18PRO and 18S , just put together is 168 , in three years I will choose 22 , which together means love to go well , love to get rich Sorry , put the wrong picture  DOGE  Changed It s outrageous , a quarter of an hour has passed and it has nt changed changed The feel of the iPhone is not good at all . It is not recommended to compare it with the iPhone . Even if the iPhone 12 last year is so light , I feel that it is not as comfortable to hold as many domestic flagship phone spersonal subjective feeling , if it is different , you are right  How to pursue high  end without comparing iPhone ? Do you want to compare those with the same price as him ? There is a saying that goes well , the weak wield the knife to the stronger , not the weak wield the knife to the weaker . Mi vs iPhone ? ios ? A14 ? Or the ability to adjust the lens ? How courageous  Always have to rush , just like Lei Jun founded Xiaomi company at that time . Said to be the first in the world . In case it is successful . I know you are afraid of being scolded , and I agree with your statement . I am afraid that you will be scolded  eat melon   doge  when the water army comes . The Xiaomi Mi 12 definitely feels good in the hand , but the comparison is wrong . I can see that it is the max , and the max is even more uncomfortable .  Allow sad  If he wants to enter the high  end ranks , he must find a good one to set off himself , but I think it is not enough to find this , Ray s contrast method , beats everything The good thing about the iPhone is the texture  Doge  Really no one buys the oneplus for the second time  hee hee  change 7pro for 9pro , 7pro experience is ok , I really wo nt buy it again after using 9pro I bought a 7pro , and also recommended a few friends to buy 4 , but the system was not updated later , and the current system is super bad  Yun Bei  Ruthless A bunch of pictures of KuAn  DOGE  Why are you not a member and you can still post pictures Do nt mention family members everywhere That s right , buying a mobile phone should nt be like this  Yunbei  Buy it if you like it , do nt buy it if you do nt like it  Yunbei  Even family members are mentioned ?  Yunbei  The iPhone 11 is really bad . I was so angry that I want to drop my phone . There is no service in the elevator in the underground garage , the code is often not scanned in the shopping mall . The game will be cut off when playing , and the network will also be cut off for half a minute to receive a text message .  Very happy  The same underground garage , I have a spare Honor mobile phone can still use 3 g network , I really ca nt stand this baseband It did nt happpen to me  Yun Bei  You do nt , I have , There are a bunch of people who like  11 signal is poor  , which means that it is really bad . . All right , I ll use it myself Sometimes in the basement of the mall , trying to scan the QR code to pay the parking fee is killing me  Yun Sad  It s so annoying , the basement is too hot  Tears  Playing Chicken is always stuck Just to decide whether to buy a 13 or a pro . The battery life of the mini is not very good , can you give me some advice ? I m tired of the big screen phone , it s too heavy , I do nt usually play games , so I just swipe Weibo 13 battery life is a little better than PRO Is the screen red ? I do nt think so , I bought in JD.com Indeed , I wang to change to Mini , too . I usually chat on WeChat on my mobile phone and look at Weibo , Zhihu , etc . Too big is useless . Still prefer the small screen Yes , I want to return to a small screen mobile phone MINI is OK , I replace it from 12 pm , the battery life is general The third point , I think Meizu has always been the mainstream level for taking pictures . I think your oneplus 9pro is garbage How can Meizu beat the OnePlus 9pro s camera , it s already good to beat the x3 Let me put it this way , I admit that I ca nt beat it , I can only say that it is not much . NONONO , too much worse , to be honest , in some aspect , even p50pro ca nt beat oneplus 9pro Let s look at it dialectically , the sales volume is good , Meizu still has potential , and said without anger . vivo y series , oppo a series and Huawei Enjoy series are also selling well . Not just good , but super good . Why does e  waste sell so well , is nt it just to deceive those who do nt understand mobile phones ? Does a phone sells well mean a good phone ? What is the cost effectiveness of the Redmi thousand yuan machine now ? Look at the note10 , Dimensity 700 and that piece of garbage brightness screen , 18w fast charge ? It was completely beaten by Realme Q3  The screen of Note10pro is also garbage , but everything else is fine Then why do nt you compare Huawei and Honor 720p high  definition screen  puzzling  It s all rubbish , why bother with another rubbish , the brightness is not as good as the previous redmi , I wanted to buy note10Pro , but I could nt do it , then bought Realme for my mother . The Redmi 1000 yuan machine has only begun to exert its strength this year . Note Pro , the realme series , has a few press conferences in a month  two ha  After all , the thousand yuan machine has to increase the price . If the screen is better , it will be castrated in other places . Is the screen the most basic thing ? That s right Holding the k40 , the Mi 9 was originally used . To be honest , the unlocking speed of the k40 is indeed faster , but the experience , relatively speaking , I still prefer the fingerprint under the screen of the Mi 9 , especially when paying with fingerprints . Exactly the same as me , from Xiaomi 9 to K40 . I was mad by the battery of Mi 9 , otherwise I planned to wait for the next generation of SOC , 888 was too bad I did nt notice it at the time , there are sockets in the office and it can be charged at any time Mi 9 fingerprint payment can not be recognized for a long time , recognition is depending on luck , not as fast as K40 Indeed , But the pleasure of unlocking from the front is better than from the side , probably because all the mobile phones I have used before are unlocked from the front  allow sad  How about the K40 , the same Mi 9 , the battery is too bad , the others are ok The system is really complicated ... it is more difficult than MIUI Never used Samsung mobile phones My last one was the S10e , and the feel . . . Better than the S20 , but there is no high brush , the configuration is a bit low , and the screen is too small . S20 is perfect Upgraded already But in fact , it is powerful without tossing anything , and you can use more if you want to use it . It s easier to use after doing it Why do you say that the Mate 40Pro camera is not good , and there are girls around you who still dislike taking portraits ?  Erha  Because they all use the original iPhone camera , and then they have been repaired in the later period  Girls  post  editing ability is super strong . So what is needed in the early stage is real rather than Huawei s automatic ps  p50pro in my hand is really good at  p  , I do nt know much about Android  How about p50 ? P50 does not have 5 G so I still do nt want to buy it I have never used the p50 , and it is really not recommended without 5G. I use the pro because I have WiFi6 at home , which can make up for the 5 G defect of the p50pro . There are still a lot of Hongmeng appliances at home , and the mate40pro ca nt get it , so I have to buy this one . Taking pictures is alright , although it is negatively optimized , it is not to the point of being scrapped , and the video is really not good . Well , I ve been checking whether there is a 5 G version recently . After you finish speaking , I m a little hesitant . Although it is a negative optimization , the foundation is there , the hardware is still very good Taking pictures is ok , but Apple is better for video recording . The xr in my hand supports 4k60 frames . I personally feel that the video shot by m40p is not as good as the xr  two hatwo hatwo ha  OnePlus has always been garbage , not a cloud user , I have used 1  1 6 8pro and dare not buy 9pro again I bought it on Jingdong and then returned it  Erha  It s hot for daily use The spiritual shareholder downstairs did nt want to hear this . I was completely scared by the Xiaomi Mi 11 . The power is run out of for 3 hours  laugh cry  , will the spiritual shareholder get angry when he sees it  doge  My classmates have bought Mi 11 , which is really electricity consumable One plus is the worst , there are a lot of praise for one plus , speechless , it is the worst mobile phone ever used Most of them are cloud users , thinking that Coloros can save OnePlus , but they do nt know that Coloros has already killed OnePlus , and OnePlus will only be more embarrassed in the future Oneplus s photos are often blurred and the battery life is not good . I ca nt stand it so I switch to Xiaomi  s. This year s price is very conservative , ca nt sell better than Xiaomi . One plus is really not good for taking pictures . The same sensor is 689 . The camera is not as good as the findx2pro . The battery life needs to be simplified to be better , but now with the coloros , it is slightly better . X80 vs 12u which is better If the X80 telephoto is not 50 million , it still ca nt beat 12U , except that the telephoto VIVO is better You did nt read the revelations The spilling tea says is 5000W , who knows if it will be cut again before the release This also depends on the comparison of specific items . Blue Factory s algorith m is good , and there should be no suspense for portraits and night scenes . As for the main camera imaging , telephoto and video 12u are leading , and the camera algorith m of Xiaomi Mi 12 is also improved compared to the previous generation . Definitely the best hardware 12u , it should be 12u Does the k50pro have four speakers ? It s more important to me than the motor Phone with four speakers ? dreaming You leave me speechless . Someone posted a Weibo saying that k50 g , jbl four speakers Then buy a k50 G , Pro may have to pay attention to taking pictures , but certainly not the speakers , and the screen may not be as good as this , just like the k40 g , the k40 g has the best quality of workmanship in the whole brand What are you thinking Could it be that pro is not as good as G ?  Allow sad  . Not really . how is this possible What are you thinking ?  Unintelligible  hh , it seems that it does nt matter if you do nt play games at present , 11u upgrades 12pro , taking pictures , experience , charging perception is obvious , the screen feels the same , especially taking pictures , taking pictures and outputting pictures are very fast , and the details and colors are much more normal than 11u . Very satisfied , there are no bugs in 13 ui  dogedogedoge  Yes , I think everyone should not always focus on the excellent performance of high load , other improvements brought by the chip are also very important , just leave the large game to the game phone The medium and low load of 8g1 is also not good . The temperature of daily use is higher than that of a15 and Kirin 9000 , and even not as good as the 865 of the year before last  eat melon  It may be because many software have not been upgraded to 64  bit , and the large and medium cores of 8g1 only support 64  bit , so all 32  bit software can only be supported by the super  large core , and the power consumption will naturally be high . Yes , testing those games and checking the frame rate power consumption is really boring for people who do nt play big games If one day , when the uploaders  test is also hot when daily use , can this phone still play games ? I do nt quite agree with your point of view . Now the bloggers test , the temperature basically revolves around the game , but for people like me who play games for up to an hour a day , it does nt matter at all , I focus on the Power consumption , heat generation , and battery life in the case of daily using Weibo , navigation , watching videos , listening to music , chatting , etc . , but I ca nt find this kind of data . Today s phone reviews put too much emphasis on peak performance , with half of the videos testing games That is , bells and whistles If you want to take pictures , just buy Mi  eat melon  Xiaomi ca nt , Xiaomi diving is very serious . The diving is serious because of the use of the Snapdragon 888 . If you want to buy one with a good camera , at this stage , you can only choose Apple , as well as Snapdragon 888 and Snapdragon 8 mobile phones , all of which are diving machines . However , Android is indeed expensive now , so Apple seems more normal . That is , most female buy Xiaomi , and most male buy Redmi , but the Xiaomi Mi Yout h Edition ca nt take pictures well , and it is not as good as the Redmi K30pro zoom version . It s too difficult for you to buy a good camera with a 2,000 yuan , now the positioning is very clear Looking forward , like vivo y7s iqoo is so good to use , mine is iqooz3 My colleague bought iqoo on Double 11 , saying that playing games will be stuck , and taking pictures will not work . I do nt play the game  Haha   Haha   Haha   Original system Originos Ocean  Very durable , I bought it in 19 years , very  Chinese praise  The problem with the k40 is that the camera is not as good as the k30 It s useless for a guy , I bought an 11ultra , but I have nt used the camera 1 . You do nt need it , it does nt mean others do nt need it . 2 . If you do nt need it now , it does nt mean you will never use it in the future . It may be used occasionally . When you need it and do nt have it , this is the most annoying . 3 . The k40 is also fine for daily use , but the disgusting thing is that the camera has been reduced compared to the previous generation . In terms of cost performance , the k40 is very good , but why do you spend more money on Xiaomi and not buy the k40 ? I bought a k40 before , and then I bought an 11u . I still like the k40 At that time , the 870 leapfrogged Indeed It is hoped that various brands can make more efforts to optimize the bottom layer of the system , so that a mobile phone can be used smoothly for two more years . If I tell you , I have used this mate30PRO for more than two years . Except for the occasional background cut that is a bit slow , the rest is very smooth . Do you believe it ?  eat melon   eat melon  , the key is to see the manufacturer s optimization Look carefully , what the loor host said is two more years , not just two years of smooth use . System maintenance can last for three years , so it should not be difficult to use four years Do nt blame each system , you look at the domestic software environment , chat software ca nt wait to include all of them , an APP often has several Gs , alas The underlying architecture of Android is like that , the foundation is not strong , and the effect of optimization by manufacturers is not obvious . 50 million units is only a medium  sized player . When will it exceed 100 million units to truly become a major manufacturer . I think it is impossible for this brand to exceed 100 million units from birth to cancellation , foreign Apple Samsung , domestic Mi ov glory . This is the sales volume of 6 mobile phone manufacturers in total , and the status is difficult to shake . What is the status of glory ? It is nothing without Huawei . N ot as competitive as other brands Honor is bad this year?Er Ha  System optimization is good , hardware is poor , Realme is the opposite When will realme reach 100 million , and Xiaomi will be done Xiaomi s 12th year of bankruptcy Can shake the glory who said it ? My realmex7pro is well optimized , also Dimensity . I only like this one in 1000  . Every time I turn on the camera or record a video , it s very stuck  Khan  The same Dimensity 1000  , that one is better optimized than the x7pro ? The x7 is poor , the others are okay , every time I want to take pictures and videos , it is very uncomfortable  Sweat  Do nt say it , my battery life is super poor , the heat is serious , and the charging became slow . Sure ? My charging is getting slower and slower , even when I play King s Glory , it still loses power while charging  VisionVision  One person urges Mi 12  laughing   laughing  Bought a 12pro . Xiaomi buys even numbers instead of odd numbers  dogedoge  Change from 10U , the photo is really cool , the color , focus , and night shots are all very good The 10u sensor is better , but unfortunately the experience is too bad , this generation pays more attention to the experience I also think it s too slow to take pictures 1  Yun Bei  Samsung 2K high brush is awesome Honor V10 I m using it now , I m considering changing the phone , but I have nt been stuck until the end of this year . After upgrading to Hongmeng , the lag improved , but there was a restart . The power consumption is accelerated , and the typing response is slowed down . Mine also has frequent restarts , and I changed the motherboard later  I wonder if yours has a low sound ? It does nt work even you turn it on very loudly . This no . I plan to use it as a backup machine , and now I m tired of typing and and the delay is too serious . Mine appearance is still very new  Yunbei  I really do nt want to change it . The v10 top version I bought at the end of 2017 is still smooth , the memory is enough , and it is still fast charging . After upgrading Hongmeng , it is better to use . If it was nt for wanting to change to 5 g , it would nt retire  although it s also a backup machine now , used to watch dramas and watch videos  I changed the motherboard for free , and I changed the battery myself . Except for the sometimes dropped frames when playing games , there is no problem . Is there no 120W in the ordinary version ? If the normal version has 120 watts , then the processor can only give you Dimensity 920 . Why is the overseas version of Xiaomi 11tpro 888  5000 battery 120w  doge  I think it should be cut The 11tPro s photos are mediocre , and the charging is great  doge  The standard version uses 67w very well , the speed is not slow Redmi 67W is half slower than Xiaomi 67W Deficient than better , excess than worse Note11p has 120 , do you buy ? That is the leading offline machine . why ? I am considering buying one . Oppo or oneplus which is better Do nt buy a OnePlus , after seven months of use , the software response began to slow down , and the photos were really mediocre   My 7 Pro s photos can still beat the new mid  range phone , and it s not inferior to the iPhone 11 Pro Max of the year . It s a real experience . Unless you ca nt take pictures ? I am talking about OnePro 9Pro , talking after using OPPO , OnePlus system maintenance really can fool us , and now ColorOS is also castrated , and there is no more sincerity than the Realme in the next door . . . I have used three OnePlus , two Xiaomi , and four Huawei . In addition to taking pictures , OnePlus is still the smoothest Android after upgrading the system . 11promax s battery life is yyds hahaha The battery life is alright , that s definitely not as good as the current iPhone s battery life  two ha  How should I say it ? I think the heat dissipation of 12 pm is too poor to hold down the a14 . The battery life of two 12 pm I used is not very good  laugh cry  It s a bit difficult Do you play games ? 13promax should be stronger than 11promax if only 60hz is opened  eat melon  hhhh Why disconnection , advertising Why do I have changed so many Xiaomi devices without advertising and disconnection ? You are a follower of the Internet , you are really Mi antifan , if you do nt like it , please do nt say any thing , thank you There are advertisements , various recommended advertisements , you will still have some if you change the settings , but I have never encountered any disconnection . Because the performance is too good , I ca nt find a reason to change other brands ? Really?I plan to change my phone , but I do nt know what to change My Mi 6 battery is not durable , everything else works fine It just does nt feel good to use it . Is that so ? To be honest , the front view of mix4 is not as good as last year s k30 pro with lifting camera , at least in terms of screen quality , there is still a gap between Huaxing Optoelectronics and Samsung , Although the under  screen camera is hidden well , I experienced the selfie effect offline . , is really indescribable . Not to mention the photo effect , the astigmatism and hazy in the process of opening the real  time shooting , there is no experience at all Did nt you watch the press conference ? He is actually hazy when shooting , and then optimizes the sample through the mix4 algorith m Please , 8 years of Mi fan , Mr. Lei s conference , how could I not watch it  allow sad  So , it can only do this first , because the under screen , so the quality of the screen is not good . It is already fine to be able to make it like this . If you want a curved surface like Ultra , because it is a domestic screen , everyone will say mix s green border is so severe , and it s like this , there will always be someone to pick on the fault , is nt it ? If they make a mix that you think is ok , others will think that this is a super stacking mix , is there any explorations and ideas ? Nonsense , the front view is much better than the k30p , at least the screen is still relatively transparent , and the r  angle is more coordinated , and the frame is narrower . Although the preview of the selfie is very poor , the picture is ok . Lei Jun also said , do nt buy mix4 if you like selfies.two ha  Still K30P is a real full screen These troll can only do this I laughed so hard , what kind of apple do you use , 11 or xr ? You are too embarrassed to say that Apple is good when you use a cheap version of Apple , and you can say it if you replace apple every year with more expensive apple of over ten thousand . Do nt use a 6s for a few years to say that Apple is good Sorry , I used xr , you said xr is cheap ? More than 5,000 you say cheap ? Tell me if you can afford it It s terrible . Five thousand yuan is expensive  laugh crylaugh crylaugh cry  Of course , I also hate the big black border of Apple s departure from the times , Apple s broken signal , Apple s ugly pill camera , 5v1a slow charging that will not change , and today s mediocre and incompetent innovation Even so , it is the number one in market value and sales . The market value not only includes Apple s mobile phone business , Apple is a great company , but these operations of the iPhone in the past few years have really disappointed me , a user used from the 4s to the 6s . In addition , the number one mobile phone sales and shipments in the world has always been Samsung , not apple It s true that Android s imaging quality has left Apple behind  doge  But the camera experience is still far from Apple . As far as mobile phones are concerned , I still like to take photos with Apple . No , in fact , the Google pixel camera experience is almost the same as that of Apple . Google processor is too bad You know nothing about filming  laughing  In fact , Apple is not so difficult to catch up , Google s photo is really good  dogedoge  The Leica m240 is better . Of course , the handling is better after the m10 . The control of M10 is obviously not as good as M240 . This is one of the biggest setbacks of 10 compared to 240 . The design pursues  minimalism  too much , and many commonly used function keys are directly removed . m10 sensitivity control wheel is good to use The sensitivity dial is the ingenuity  failure of the M10 . The ingenuity is that the creativity is very good , and the failure is that the feel is very bad , which is much more difficult to use than the ISO key combination on the 240 . 240 is too thick , the biggest optimization of m10 is to improve the feel Yes , the biggest optimization of m10 is that in a sense , it finally realizes the digitalization of film M . The single  cell charging is slow and the life is long . The dual  cell charging is fast and the life is short . So why does the Xiaomi battery age faster , even basic common sense does not know   Yun sad  How about Xiaomi 67w single cell , 5000 battery , 100 battery in 36 minutes . Xiaomi math series are almost all dual  cell , Redmi digital series single  cell Do nt talk nonsense here , except that the Mi 10u is a dual  cell , which digital series of Xiaomi is a dual  cell , almost all of them ? Do nt you think before you speak ? Single  core 66W is not enough  puzzle  Omg , go to a repair shop and see who has the worst battery ? ? What makes you lie through your teeth There are still so many bugs in the mobile phone , you can still fall asleep , I admire  callcall  Xiaomi Mi 12 , especially rubbish . It took less than a week . The screen is black for no reason , and the fingerprint is not easy to use . I can only use the power button , and nothing fixed after I change one . Same problem . Ask customer service to return , all kinds of shirk . Then after the return time , just let me go to repair . . Do you make mobile phones like this , sell them like this , and bully consumers like this ? ? ? ? ? ? The last Weibo was in 13 years , dddd  Black Line  do you understand?Go home and ask your mother , you will understand better Can you stop smear Xiaomi  too happy   too happy  you troll You did nt go to Peking University , you can still fall asleep ? What I like most is the texture and feel of OnePlus , followed by the stability and smoothness of colors . As for the OnePlus 10PRO , the absolute screen ltpo2.0 is more attractive to me . Did you get paid ? Come on , let s talk , where do you see that I ve received money ? Because I do nt think the OnePlus 10 feels good in the hand . Unable to experience offline  DOGE  Go to the oppo authorized store around you and see , it should already be there .  Applause   Applause   Applause  Apple firstly does not have fast charging , and secondly the signal is poor , and many of Android s technologies have surpassed it . This 13 , sales strategy is to force you to buy PM directly , 256 g is not available , and the charger also said that it will not be sent for environmental protection . When will you be willing to say , ah Apple You re going too far  Who told you that Apple does nt have fast charging and 256 g ? Do nt pretend you understand if you do nt , okay ? How can there be fast charge , do nt tell me 20w is fast charge  too happy   too happy  It does have fast charging , but you have to buy it yourself But its mobile phone is really good , who will use vivo after using Apple well said I saw a comment section saying  Is nt bringing an Apple up the same as bringing a bug ?  allow sad   doge   DOGE  Can Qualcomm chip be available now ? It s mainly a software system problem , it has nothing to do with the chip , and the p30 is not 100  domestic  dogedogedoge  But it is designed by themselves  Picking nose  The premise is that there is a signal , I heard that Apple s signal is not very good Mainly space is close to satellites  doge  Saying this is not afraid of Apple fan troll , in their opinion apple is the safest  doge  The x60pro really beats Xiaomi in photography , especially for portraits . If the photography is still bad , the vivo brand does nt need to be continued . That Huaihaizikehao , you made me laugh , and you blocked me ? Have some level , okay ? Did you see the word especially ? You do nt know Chinese characters ? In addition to the details , Xiaomi is a little richer than vivo , the color matching is really defeated by vivo Then can you understand the word  complete victory  ? Do you understand the meaning of Chinese characters ? It was said in the front that the photo was totally win , but why did you add details worse than the vivo ? Is nt it a win ? Slap in your face ? Take more look at the blind test and compare The simplest comparison is iqoo neo5 s 598 compared to k40pro s 686 , neo5 beat k40pro , please see Zhong Wenze s iqoo neo5 comparison video for details , use better hardware to make the worst experience , only Xiaomi can do it It s coming . As soon as I said , the blue factory boaster came Touted or not , look at the link I posted . Click in and see for yourself , look at the child s hair , look at the watermark in the lower left corner Mi 11U does nt have a portrait lens at all , how to compare , compare with air ? Why do nt you say that the 11U periscope beats the x60Pro ? Double standard dog  pick nose  The battery life is so poor After the upgrade , the battery life is worse ? which model ? 13  Tears  Mine is 13p , why did nt I feel The system needs to run data , use it again before saying .  allow sadness   allow sadness   allow sadness  Huangjia evaluation   With a lower temperature , the same performance is obtained ,  xiaomi12Pro  is indeed a success in dragon training   The subtitles on the curved screen are not fully displayed , and the technicians need to optimize it . Tutu is here , the private message has been delivered , please pay attention to check it The 11u supported by 6999 is overheated and disconnected from the network every day . I have asked two after  sales service , either no one cares or not support . I do nt supprot it anymore , and the fan turns the hater . Tutu is here , the private message has been sent , please pay attention to check  I would like to ask when Xiaomi will not be an assembly plant for foreign parts and take the road of innovation to be self  sufficient ? MIUI is not good to use , even more uncomfortable than OriginOs . I feel that Xiaomi has complicated the UI system Do nt yygq in the post , I have tried iQOO many times , it is indeed better than Xiaomi , at least the desktop animation iQOO is much more complete use the K30 while saying the orange system is better ? The system is really good , very smooth  laugh  That s because the original os does nt have anything , only changed the skin . Miui has many functions , so sometimes do nt know how to use it . For you , I think you are more suitable for Apple , and Samsung s oneui is also not suitable for you . Animation is much better than MIUI I think miui is better than originos Die of laughter , originOS is the complicate one actually , a desktop setting like the system setting , bells and whistles Catch  Heha  mogul 6  128 Qualcomm 480 sells 599 is awesome Buying a second  hand Mi 8 , is nt the experience better than it ? Taking pictures , chips , and system fluency have been fully upgraded , and in the second  hand market is only a little over 600  dogedoge  It s freeze sometimes , my Mi 6 is not as stable as my dad s Redmi 9 , especially freeze when use Taobao Why is your Mi 6 still in use , you have no desire to change it , or it is just used as a backup machine ? The Snapdragon 480 has similar specifications to the Dimensity 700 , but it is likely to be more expensive . You can see the price of the Dimensity 700 and know it is impossible . The 480plus has been released , the price of 480 should be reduced No matter how the price is reduced , it is still more expensive than MediaTek . Now MediaTek s 4 G chip G25 Redmi 9A 4  64 G sells for 599 . How could it be possible to use the Qualcomm 5 G chip 480 , which has 4 times the performance , and increase the memory to 6  128 , then still selling at 599  allow sadness  In that case , let s not talk about the cost , the Redmi digital series does nt even need to sell the standard version of the note series 1080 60Hz 18W fast charge Snapdragon 480 scan code photography 4  128 599 The entry model is not necessary , 64 is enough One  stop , replace it with 13promax  dogedoge  , holding this , the battery life is simply outrageous How outrageous is the battery life ? How does it compare with the domestic 5000mAh battery ? I personally feel that the battery life is stronger than the domestic 5000 mAh It s not on the same level at all , I feel that the battery life is too perverted Is the battery life good or not ? Battery life is really good It must be very heavy to hold the mobile phone Yes , the battery life is so good that beyond imagination How great is the battery life ? How does it compare with the domestic 5000mAh battery ? win casually I hope that Xiaomi will stock up a little more this time , and I can get it before New Year s Day . I do nt know the stocking situation of Xiaomi . Motorola may stock a lot this time . Motorola s official Weibo send the message that 100 new Snapdragon 8 series chip mobile phones will be give out during the conference on the 9th , and it will be the only mobile phone that can get in December have the new chip . And if there is no accident , it will be the only new flagship that will be available this month So the question is , how many people will buy a mobile phone with a bad system because of the first 8 Gen 1 That s right  laughing cry  I feel that the Mi 12 should have something good this time  Is it going to pull out the nail household of Mi 6 ? There are not many Mi 6 nail households . Who have used 5 G , large screens and high brushes these years , will basically ca nt go back . But there are not many mobile phones with such a good feel as the Mi 6 Is the 2019 XR worth changing to 13pro ? The same question Decided not to buy it hahaha , change a battery My memory is small , otherwise I can wait another year  two ha  Mine is 19xr , I ordered 13pro Which color  Hahaha , wait for a feedback , I do nt know if the difference between 13pro and XR is very big . It must be sierra blue . For the xr , the camera and screen should be an epic improvement Is there any phone in the mid  end of Honor that is better for taking pictures ?  Yunbei  I bought a 60pro on Double Eleven , but it turned out that the pictures were not as good as my V30pro , so I returned it ..... The image of v30pro is not not only worth 3k price  laugh cry  outrageously strong It s really strong  Yun Bei  I was shocked for the first time to shoot at night , like the night vision instrument ... What s even more terrifying is that the v30pro set of three ois , the main , wide and long , do not make up the number , except for the three  camera color difference , there is basically no shortcoming , the current flagship may not have this configuration The 60pro is too bad for taking pictures . Compared with the Honor X10 , the night scene is a mess  I really speechless about it  allow sadness   allow sadness   allow sadness  Yes  It s like being blind at night  But the four curved surfaces are really great  disappointed  but the camera is so bad I ca nt stand it Night scene , I am really tired of complaining  V used to be the strongest in Honor , and Honor 60 is currently positioned as medium . If you buy a downgrade , you will definitely not be able to beat  doge  I feel that my V30pro can still fight for several years , it s still the core of 990  allow sad  Yes , the 30pro in my hand can still work , and even the daily use of the V20 is still no problem  doge  Do nt be heartbroken , the Redmi with 870 and the direct screen can beat any one  doge  Holding the K40 , the straight screen is indeed much more comfortable than the curved surface  two ha  Yes , I bought 11u for taking pictures , but it was annoying to get the UV film off after a month . Now I can only use the hydrogel film that Xiaomi post  sale gives You can buy a broken screen insurance , use without film , the money you spend to change a few UV films a year is enough for broken screen insurance iqooneo5 expresses doubts  dogedoge  It must be hard to beat iqoo  doge  Then does nt the plastic midframe feel awkward ? Although you are very strong , but you are not resistant to falling , you know it hurts when you fall it I usually wear case  Doge  Honor 20pro is super good to use Yes  Mine is also this model , it feels super good to use , I do nt like fingerprints on the back It s more sensitive than the under  screen  laugh cry  Holding blue water jade , like it for you  cool  Mine is also Honor 20p , it feels super easy to use , the unlocking speed is faster than the fingerprint on the screen Yes , it is much better to use than my original P10  Yunbei  If you say that you tested it yourself , I believe it . Or you said that you have used the flagships in the same period , and I believe it . What is your nonsense skill ? The bottom layer of ios and Android is different . Android consumes more power , and the battery capacity is also there . The power consumption of the dragon s chip is not as good as that of the A s . If you tell me that the pro is not better in this case , I can believe , but why is it impossible for the pm ? The bottom layer of Android consumes more power . I have learn about mechine for two or three years . This is the first time I heard it . Where did you get it ? Background bottom layer problem I really understand , the battery life of the 13promax is really scary Really ? I have nt used it and I do nt know , have you compared it with other Android phones ? Or how is your daily use ? I really use 13PM . I tested it with a full charge and played without interruption . It can be used for about ten hours and there is about 20  left . This is true , I never thought that Apple s battery life would be so good  Yun sad  This is really no bragging , I have a 10u and a 13pm , the battery life of the 13 can be more than one and a half 10u . I do nt think these two are comparable . We should compare it with Huawei or Meizu that have good battery life , but the A15 plus that big battery should be good in theory . Mi 10u is just okay in Android , and the battery life is similar to Mi 10 . I also have a Meizu , but it s 17pro . This year , Huawei s mobile phone battery life is really average . The 13pro max is really far ahead of the second , just like the mate30pro of that year . Not all scenes need 120Hz , just put it on the table , what do you need 120Hz for ? What to do with 120Hz for watching video ? Maybe I did nt say it clearly enough . You see , if this car keeps running at 120 kilometers per hour , you ofn course feel that it is smooth . Suddenly it changes to 100 or 80 . You can definitely feel it . The same for mobile phones . Assuming the optimization is very good , I do nt believe that going from 60hz to 120hz is not noticeable , unless this is done in a very short time , it ca nt be felt I do nt think you know what is LTPO Anyway , Android does not save power , and Apple s is not smooth , just know the result , and they are not as easy to use as the global 120 . What I want to express is that the global 120hz is easier to use than the ltpo , it ca nt save electricity , my wife s 90hz use not shorter than my 60 , especially when I look at the side head , OnePlus or what , anyway , there are several Androids , ltpo does nt have any power saving effect So , this is the gap between Android LTPO and Apple . Whether Android has this technology or not is high power consumption . But if you want to say the global 120Hz , it is too unfriendly to users . Android is poor in optimization , pure heap hardware , regardless of the optimization experience . A 4300mAh 13PM has a higher battery life than a 5000mAh Android , which exposes the prototype of Android s LTPO So Apple is awesome , Apple s power saving is due to system , processor , screen , and many reasons , not just one screen ltpo The 12u chip is poor , the power consumption is high , the heat is hot , and the battery life is short . Honestly , it s not a smear . My Xiaomi Mi 11U is the top configuration . This price is not too low . The 60 frame rate of the King of Glory can not be stabilized . The standby time and battery life are short , the room temperature is 25 degrees , standby not used from 96  , and the phone has 45  of power left at 5 oclock in the afternoon . No matter what price you buy for Android , you only have that chip on the flagship , even you buy 10,000 Samsung as well . As for standby power consumption , you think it is in standby , actually rogue software is still work Why does nt 12u have dual versions , Dimensity  Qualcomm  tears  Dimensity is here would be better . Better energy consumption than a14 Where does the confidence come from to compared to a14 Do nt you know how to watch the test ?  Question  palying games stuck Yes , I agree  Yun Bei  Extreme Mode , turn 90 frames on , but only 30 It s useless if you turn on the extreme mode , you have to turn on the performance mode in the game acceleration menu to let go a little Victory is one thing , the key is that most of the top flagships of mobile phone manufacturers dare not use Dimensity 9000  dogedogedoge  Redmi directly uses Dimensity 9000 to beat Xiaomi 12 The victory in terms of games and heating and battery life is certain , and the quality and sound quality of photos are definitely not as good as 12 . God , you already know the texture of the unreleased machines , who are you ? Because it is not easy to debug photography , but I can consider accepting a mobile phone that does not good at taking pictures . The Dimensity 9000 is still good at around 3000  doge  K50P is beckoning to you At least in February next year  eat melon  is still a long time 1500 , want or not ? I just bought the k30s yesterday and felt confused now Why buy k40 at this price , this price can buy the full version of k40 , 8  128 is a bit less It means the 30s ? The k40 has many shortcomings . Chose it because of the psychology of the head or tail . Full blood 865 . Too thick and bad for taking pictures Where can I buy it now Taobao and Pinduoduo have many refurbished mechine of this model , so be careful . It is best to buy from the grain factory . I m afraid of note , it s all Dimensity No loss , actually 10s is fine I dare not touch the 888 , and I am a little hesitant to see the power  down feedback and fever related to the 870 game . Maybe it depends on the optimization of the system . I feel that 865 has less negative reviews I do nt think the MIX product line is worse than the iPhone . Much worse    The system will not work . After so many years , the heat problem has not been solved yet  And there are more other questions On the contrary , I just think the system is very useful , only there are too many advertisements , and there is no abnormality about the heat . I have nt encountered any advertisements , the battery life of the mobile phone is not very good , the heat is serious , and there are various small bugs . I visit the forum every day , and I have used several versions of the system , but it is still a little bit worse . Because that s what you think So you use both ? Or just cloud assessment ? The mobile phone can be used , but how do you know about the product line ? MIX is still far away Well said , I choose OnePlus 9Pro , it s cheaper 9Pro bright silver looks good I like that light blue , but only 9rt has it  two ha  That seems to be cyan  blue ?  Yunbei  The battery life is not too good , 888  doge   doge  The battery life of the 10Pro is similar , the telephoto is reduced , and the IP68 is no longer available . The processor 8 is as hot as the 888  two hatwo hatwo ha  The 10 Pro has much better battery life The processor of Mi 3 , the first  generation Fire Dragon of the top version of Mi Note , the black  sided aircraft carrier of Mi 5 , the copy of Mi 8 , the battery of Mi 9 , the WIFI of Mi 11 ... There are really too many small problems . Some people still say that burning Wi  Fi in 11 is 888 s problem  eat melon  Why did nt the others burn ? Meizu 18 is also thin and light but did nt happened Meizu 18 also burned  Erha  but it just burned the motherboard directly , and then restarted ... Because the redmi note 10pro is cheap , I bought it for me , but it was only three days after I got it , I was playing , and suddenly the screen went black for no reason . Mi 2S , Mi 5 , Mi 8 , I really think they are the three most successful mobile phones of Xiaomi . Mi 5 is still at my home . It feels so good and comfortable , however it is very hot , but there is no problem with playing games . Mi 8 Not to mention anything else , the battery life , I have been used for three years , and the bright screen is still about 6 hours . The point is that the MIUI12.5 problem has not been encountered . My Mi 8 did nt encounter the 12.5 bug , but the battery life ... The phone basically grows on the charging cable . I replaced a battery last year . The bright screen time dropped to about 4 hours before , so I replaced it , and it was over 6 after the replacement . 11 s wifi is mainly 888 heating and power consumption problem , plus the 11 series design is very thin . In addition , 11 s various configurations are very good , and it is the only one within 4000 that supports Dolby Vision Why does Xiaomi burn if other mobile phones do nt burn ? Nothing else burns ? It s just that the sales are not that big . 2999 You buy a Snapdragon 865 dual speaker , 90hz , x  axis mobile phone for me , thank you . Check the attribute clearly  eat melon  Such a eliminated configuration , I would rather not buy a mobile phone . Thank you   Now it seems that realmex50pro is the most suitable  kneeling  I suggest you buy iphone11promax or samsung s20u directly , realme is just an eliminated configuration Samsung is huge , heavy , and impractical . iPhone s do nt have 5 G yet . do not buy 3999 high match also does nt have 3999 Why do nt you buy Xiaomi 10 ? ? ?  Doge  Really full screen  eat melon  Changed your tone  smile   smile  , when iqoo three , you were not so reasonable . If iQOO also 2999 , it is absolutely no one s scolding so serious  doge  Looking for a good phone for telephoto photography Wait for 12U How about VIVO X70 Pro ? I feel that several lenses take pictures well and are relatively balanced . The telephoto lens of the X70Pro is not as good as the X30Pro , the main camera and portrait lens are good The telephoto is only Xiaomi 10u and 11u Only the bottom of the Xiaomi telephoto 586 , others are not as strong  allow sad   allow sad  If you care about taking pictures , definitely x5 There are still many people recommending x3 now , you are very insightful   heart   smiling  It s ok after the price cut , but it s not cheap if you want the first release x5  two ha  Wait for 618 to make plans   Heart  Do you rely on impressions to speak ? The photos of the standard version of the find x series are already the worst batch of flagship machines of major manufacturers . Xiaomi Huawei vivo will only lose . Is the Redmi K series better for taking pictures ? Why are you talking about the battery life ? ? ? Is nt battery life good ? Maybe it s slow charging Charging is also okay The overall performance of Apple s mobile phones is really good , but now it s 2021 , and Apple s charging is still ok ? Dare I ask , have you ever used a fast charge ? Those who say that the battery life is not good have never used 11 pm or 12 pm ,  laughs without speaking  The battery life of 12 is OK , not to mention PM , it is better . Seriously , antifans may have never used an iPhone . They just follow the trend to smear all day long A pound of compressed cotton and a pound of iron are not the same weight in the hand ? I do nt mean to argue , 6.1 inches , 200 grams and 6.5 inches , 200 grams feel a lot different in the hand . The volume is slightly larger , and the weight does not feel so heavy after the weight is distributed Then you all should buy Promax MAX is too big , even if Max is only 200 grams , the feel will not feel good . Do nt come to tech bloggers at this level . Is a pound of cotton and a pound of iron the same size.Sad  Think more before making anti  intellectual remarks I feel that the 13pro is significantly heavier than the Mi 11u At that time , the materials of Xiaomi Mi 6 were the best hardware that could be bought , and the motors were all linear motors  rabbit  The linear motor is available in the Mi 2 era or the Mi 3 era , and the Mi 6 is still a Y axis  the X axis is placed vertically  Then I do nt know  doge  has known coarse grains since redmi note3 What a coincidence  laughs without saying a word  the red coarse grain note1 is a linear motor , the rest are all rotors until this year Holding the Mi 6 , it is still very easy to use , but the vibration is really not good , I have not open it because it is too bad  allow sad  At that time , it was all good materials , Others , except Meizu , are even more rubbish In fact , the front fingerprint experience of Mi 6 and P10 is very good . It was overshadowed by the full  screen wave just after its launch . At that time , the fingerprint under the screen was not mature enough , and many flagships returned to the back fingerprint , that is really attend to trifles to the neglect of essentials . As far as the front fingerprint recognition is concerned , I only support these two machines . To be honest , Xiaomi s poor quality control is well known Then why do nt I know , the quality of Mi 6 , I have used it for 3 years , except for the battery , there is almost no problem . Those who have nt used it are saying that the quality control is not good , and those who have used it like me have nt said it . Hehe , those who have used it also know that the quality control is not good , anyone who has used it or not knows Yes , who use it or not himself will know , see what mobile phone I use to reply to you now Sorry , I do not know It s not your fault that you do nt have much knowledge . The Xiaomi I used before , including those around me now , all know that the quality control of Xiaomi is not good . How many people around you ? 1.3 billion ? To be frank ? Well known ? Well , to be honest , I have used Xiaomi before , including those around me use Xiaomi now . I have been paying attention to Xiaomi since the beginning , and I am a kind of old Mi fan . Xiaomi s quality control has always been a problem . I did nt mean to smear it , it s the truth , everyone knows it Why is the minimum configuration of the Mi 8 that I have used for two and a half years is still very smooth . I have fallen it a few times and have not seen any problems  laughs without saying a word  The battery is not durable . It does nt matter , the age is here  doge  The quality control is not good I really do nt feel it Good evening Pishen , I would like to ask about Xiaomi Mi 12pro , iQOO9pro , OnePlus 10pro , which are worth it in March or April next year , is there any surprise for Xiaomi Mi 12pro ? I also want to consider iQOO9 but I ca nt put down the Mi 12  doge  What I think is that after all of them are released in March  April next year , I will compare and see which one is better . I pay more attention to the camera and the screen . I do nt play games , so I will wait and see . I also want to buy a better camera . The k30s I use ca nt take pictures at night , but now I can play games on my mobile phone . Let s see what the major manufacturers do this year What does this surprise represent ? I ca nt tell the specifics , just wait a few days , it s almost all released in March  April next year , then can compare Yes , it s quite a bucket for now Is the battery life of Findx3 good ? I see that the battery life in Xiaobai s data is quite poor . You said that if the battery life is good , this phone is ok . It s not cheap after all . The battery life of the x2pro I bought before is terrible . The oppofind series is really good , but it is this battery life that makes me dare not buy it . I definitely do nt buy a phone with poor battery life . No matter how fast you fast charge . Do you bring a charger when you go out ? I hate power banks . Unless you do nt turn on high brush , battery life is indeed the most influential factor Bought debut , used it for more than half a year . I personally think the battery life is pretty good , very satisfied Xiaomi s more than 3,000 Snapdragon 888 experience may not as good as this , so no matter how high the configuration is , it is useless if it s optimization is bad These domestic brands are all heaping hardware configuration , and the actual experience is not good . Except for Huawei , no wonder they all buy Apple now . Although Apple s hardware parameters are not top  notch , the experience is good . The system and hardware complement each other . If the system works bad , it s annoying to use  doge  Apple s configuration is not low , it is because of the system mechanism to run the memory 4 g , the configuration of other processors can be said to be the top , Apple s hardware wo nt work if it s not upgraded . The new system also relies heavily on hardware , just like computer systems . ? ? ? 666666 778 optimized to 870 ? ? ? Is the IQOO 5Pro really the best for taking pictures ?  Uh haha  Not really . The camera experience of iqoo5pro is really bad , iqoo8pro has a new algorithm , and the imaging is not lost to iqoo5 . Peanuts next door said evaluation . In addition , the iqoo8pro experience is particularly good , the camera is smoother , and the photos are synthesized later , and the camera is rarely opened with the 5 pro . Maybe I have nt tried 8p , I tried 5p and I really like it , especially the 100 million pixel mode , which is also very clear after zooming in There is no telephoto in these generations , the others are fine The main camera also went backwards  tears  The 8pro s imx766v is very well optimized , and the algorith m is decentralized . The overall performance of the main camera is still much stronger than that of the 5pro , but there is no periscope . Oneplus 9 s Hasselblad ca nt even beat Huawei s p30PRO  two ha  I went to the physical store to experience it and it felt okay , then I chose findx3  doge  My friend bought one plus 9 , and then complained to me every day that the battery life was bad  laugh cry  888 is really fast power consumption  allow sad  Are you kidding me ? When I first bought this phone , I compared it with my friend s p30Pro . It s completely different . With the 9Pro hardware here , the amount of light entering is obviously much better than that of the p30Pro . In terms of imaging and noise , they are totally different  eat melon  What we are talking about is 9 , honey , seriously review the question pleasehee hee  For girls recommend civi , the most beautiful selfie  And it looks thin I do nt take pictures very much  Yunbei  But looking at civi , it s really light and thin iqoo and Realme have produced too many mobile phones , they have not been properly trained and polished , the screen and photos are not good , and the machine is very rough , not recommended . Moreover , system upgrades and maintenance will be a problem in the future , and it is basically a one  shot deal . I ve been using this Xiaomi note3 for just four years now , and I feel like I have nt upgraded the system for a long time  tears  I only like the straight screen  Yunbei  , otherwise I would nt be so confused about which one to choose  tears  Buy it on Double Eleven , Redmi , pays attention to Redmi , or has a chance  I m going to buy it on Double Eleven , but I do nt want to buy the MIUI system this time , because I have been using Xiaomi phones before , and now I want to change the brand  laugh cry  In the evening , I will share a few real shot samples with you . Let me reveal in advance that the look and feel is quite good , and the new image algorith m has really improved the shooting experience quite a lot . Okay , looking forward to seeing how the Mi 12 takes pictures , I have nt seen it yet They were all taken casually , I did nt deliberately compose the pictures , just take a look when the time comes . Uh  huh Okay , waiting for your sharing . Let s see how the new imaging algorith m improves shooting ? That is , the imaging is fast , the capture is fast , and the filming time is short  hee hee  I feel like you use it as your main camera , and it s pretty cool to take pictures . But is it still not able to replace your vivo ? Look forward to samples Sample  puzzle  Photo  Yun Bei  Android s intermittent frame drops are really annoying . No matter how good the configuration is , it is useless . Stuck once will affect the smoothness brought by 120hz It s like Apple is not stuck , do nt boast embarrassingly , my iPad Mini5 sometimes gets stuck even when booting up and entering the page  spit  After using my 13 Pro , all Androids are stuck , without exception , the stuck is obvious Does the iPhone not get stuck on Weibo ?  doge  iPhone is really not stuck   Er Ha  Are there many bugs ? I think a lot Shh , ca nt say iPhone s are bad iPhone often gets stuck and wo nt move  laugh cry  I think Apple has more bugs than Android . But this is also a subjective opinion , do nt argue with me . Not argue . Just switched from Android to Apple , and found a lot of problems If you want to change to a photography flagship , What to expect this year ? 12 Ultra in the first half of a year , X80 Pro or Find X5 Pro in the second half of a year X90Pro in the second half of the year X80 series is full of liter cups , 80 Pro is 8475 , 80 Pro is 8gen1 and 9000 , these have already been said Samsung S22 series Do nt like Samsung s system and slow charging  Yun Bei  S22U charging seems to have reached 45W The mate50 series is absolutely strong , the hardware was that poor last year , but it is still the first echelon . Honor Xiaomi s hardware should be very strong , but the algorith m needs to be improved , let s see how is vivo s x8090 I ve used mate40 before , and it s really strong for taking pictures . I do nt know if I can get 50 or not . The signal is really poor , can you make it better ? With the same card , I still can surf the Internet in the old iPhone 8 . There is no signal in the iPhone 12 . The signal is worse and worse . Now I go out every day with two mobile phones and two cards , and use 8 to 12 to open the hotspot  cracked   crack   crack  Coincidentally , I am using 8P to provide a hot spot for 13P M , tears have wet the screen  tears  The 8 series is really amazing . It was released together with x , and it felt like it was covered up . Yes , it has all functions . The key is that the side margins of the game are very comfortable . It took me more than a month to get used to this one  allow sad  If the hotspot is turned on , the battery will drop very fast , and the heat will be particularly serious . alright It s already like this , why do nt you change the Android phone ?  Erha   No argument , just curious  Because the 8 signal is not bad , I thought it would be the same as the 8 when I changed it to 12 , who knew that Apple would become so bad Unexpectedly it s not Samsung One plus is also very good . I have been holding one plus 6 t for more than a year and have nt been stuck . I use one plus 7 pro . It is not as perfect as the Internet says , especially the system is rudimentary . Whether the system is good or not depends on personal opinion . I think it is very good . It is simple and not complicated , and it is really smooth . For the optimization of 90hz compared with the other two , it is really a complete victory . Pay attention to examine questions , big brother , domestic , your think Samsung is domestic ? Pay attention to the examination questions , there is no domestic All right Recommend Xiaomi 11Pro Then I bought the k40 and found that the k40 except is far inferior to the 11pro for the camera , it is no different from the 11pro  allow sad  The camera of this generation of Xiaomi is particularly bad , and it is all left to the processor 11pro camera experience is OK I sold my 11pro wifi after burning it and replacing it with a new one  haha  Does the 11Pro also burn ? I thought only part of the 11 had a problem 11 series all have problems The texture of the K40 is alright ... Really no   Yunbei  I thought about the 16s I bought for more than 2,000 , that s called ok It is not a product of same era . In the past , more than 2,000 flagships could be bought , but now all that can be bought are fake flagships  eat melon  It s just that the price of the 1000  yuan phone has increased . In terms of workmanship , it is possible to use a mature all  metal body with a light and thin texture . Anyway , it does not support wireless charging . The exterior can completely adopt the good  looking flagship design before , not the so  called cheap appearance now . This idea can be understood as the Apple se series It s okay pretty good The best one that comes with the original phone case is the magic2 one . Workmanship and materials are good . Really durable  Er Ha   Er Ha  Yes , minor scratches can be repaired automatically . I m still using this phone case  like  Then I go back tonight and take another look  DOGE  The case of magic2 is really good , the frosted feel is good , and it will not change color Yes , I am still using it now , very good . I bought the Mi 10s , but the screen and fast charging are not good , other aspects meet my needs If the expectations are not high , it will be no problem . I think my 10s screen and fast charging are ok , but the battery does not feel like a 4700 battery . It need to be charged twice a day , even the same as my Xiaomi Mi 8 . My 10s too , with 5 G and 90Hz on , light use , two charges a day I did nt turn on 5 g , then I used 60Hz ,  Allow sad  Taking pictures is also average , the stupid 100 million , too stuck 10PRO is okay  Jerry  My 10Pro stuck , stable version  angry  That s called the camera beats every one , everything else is fine Camera beats every one ? Now there are different scenarios with their own winners and losers . Who dares to say that it is the first . Also , do you think using the camera is more important on the phone than the screen ? During the day , everyone is similar . You insist that Apple and Samsung are better , but is nt Huawei the best in zoom and night scenes ? Are you sure the night view it is the best ? Why must the camera be emphasized ? Is this the only one of Huawei s strength ? The camera is invincible , if you do nt promote the camera , what else will you promote ? Promotional screen ? Besides , the p30pro is the best camera , but the screen is not good . Is nt everything else particularly strong ? Has the color deviation problem of the P30pro been solved ? Except for the extremely bright night scenes , which point does Samsung not beat the P30pro ? The sound performance of the screen is significantly different from that of Samsung and Apple s dual speakers , and the water drop screen is acceptable , but the screen quality is too far from the Samsung Sony Apple of the same price , and the vibration effect is loose and the experience is very poor . At the price of more than 5000 , these should be the standard configuration of the flagship . The cost of the p30 tilt is too serious , and there are too many shortcomings . Then I will also ask you , Apple s signal charging and battery life , which one is okay ? It did nt even reach the pass line . Samsung s 22.5w charging is also slow and the battery life is also poor . Is this what more than 5000 should have ? Signal , charging , battery life , appearance , which of these most important points above 5000 has all been achieved ? I m afraid only p30pro . Are these more important or a linear motor more important ? If you insist that the linear motor is more important , then when I have nothing to say Help , I just think Huawei is good to use  halohalo  Me tooI think Huawei is very comfortable to take pictures 50x zoom is awesome I have also used a lot of Huawei s styles . I think it is easy to use and I have always bought this brand . Yes , most of my surroundings are Huawei , and then I also like Xiaomi , I feel that Apple s pixels are good  because I only use it for half a year , so I do nt know much about it  I also bought Huawei because I thought it was easy to use . . . . The Hongmeng experience is poor and I has sold it out .  doge  No matter what , Hongmeng is the most stable and smooth system in my opinion except for ios . The upgrade to Hongmeng from mate20 is very smooth and does nt feel bad The last time I went to the Huawei store to get started with the nova9 , it got stuck as soon as I got started . It really surprised me .  Thinking  It is the Hongmeng system . This system may vary from machine to machine . Many friends at home and around have used Hongmeng , and the general response is smoother and more stable , but some models will have lower battery life . It should be because there are too many Huawei models , and the optimization has not been done well . It varies from machine to machine . What s so bad ? I also want to buy a p50pro  allow sad  There are many advertisements . Except for the first page of the weather app , the others are all the entrances of external link advertisements . The animations are also very general . The anti  human operation of drop  down search has not changed until now . Advertising can be turned off . I have used both note20 and 21u . It s really not worth the price , Samsung s strengths are the screen and design . Taking pictures is really ordinary , and it ca nt make much difference with domestic ones . The main camera is not as good as my 11pro max . The S21U main camera not only can not beat the S10 , but also can not beat the 11pro max . Two great guy in this building , you got ta be kidding me  It s really not as good , HDR does nt seem to be there The comment seems to be unable to post the video , come to my Weibo and watch it . What fake cell phone are you using ? The direct effect is the first every year , not to mention the Huawei Xiaomi vivo , at least it is not a problem to beat your iPhone 11 , and I do nt know where you are confident to think 11 pm can beat domestic photos . Now there is more than one main camera for taking pictures . . . Not as good as 11promax . You can try it out by posting a separate poll . According to the current video recording is not as good as Apple , taking pictures is much better than Apple . . E4 screen , 600Hz sampling rate , plus may be the strongest heat dissipation in the industry The leftovers screen of the k40 series is not worth looking forward to k40 . There are so many people buying this kind of stupid thing without heat dissipation , why is it not worth buying after having good heat dissipation ? After being cheated by K40 , do you want to be cheated again ? At the beginning , it boasted that the k40 screen was the first in the industry , it turned out to be usable ? No matter how good the heat dissipation is , with a blind screen , who can use it ? The plastic frame directly locks the heat , and it is useless to dissipate heat Let s take a look at the cooling stack , mobile phones of the same price now can not comparable to it It s probably the X80 series from Blue Factory . I ve always wanted to try it . I heard that the X series has a very strong shooting at will ability .  Jerry  The good camera has to be Huawei  doge  It s 2022 , let s take a look at it yourself . Huawei is good , why do you still use glory ? Glory s photo is too bad Huawei s photo is really good  eat melon  What is the ability to shoot at will ? Just do nt have to wait , the focus is fast , the imaging is fast , the film is fast I am also waiting for x80 , curious about the difference between Pro and Pro actual shooting The gap is big The image configuration is more powerful than the x70pro , which is unlikely . What is the advantage of nex5 over x80pp 5 is an all  around business and a stacker bucket machine , and the x80 is the flagship image . 5 Only the image is not as good as the x80 thanks NEX5 images are said to be weaker than x80pp , but stronger than x70pp Impossible , it has to be all flagships , otherwise it wo nt sell well No matter how versatile it is , it may smash the signboard of its own series . It is definitely worse than the x80 , and there will be no 120w fast charge to smash the iqoo . What is impossible , the x70 is already the flagship of last year . The blogger said yesterday that the nex is positioned as a business flagship , similar to Huawei mate . But the 70 is last year , you ca nt say that the mate40 image is not as strong as the p30 , right ? Four years of iPhone x , too stuck and want to change to 13Pro  Allow sad  You can consider Android , you will find the new world Even if it gets better with Android , it ca nt be your kind of suck phone , right ? Is it feel superior to use 4 g and 60hz iPhone 11 to comment  doge  x As long as the original product is genuine , and the memory and battery capacity are sufficient , it should not be stuck ... Forget it , how many years have passed , should nt it be stuck ? I even ca nt accept the fluency of my friend s xr  laughs haha  So many people who use x above are not stuck , I suggest you argue one by one It s been almost four years for me , I think it s okay , it s not stuck , but the battery is not durable  single dog  Change the battery I plan to change , I think it can fight for another two years There is also a OnePlus 10PRO ultra  wide  angle , no free  form lens ? I saw that some bloggers broke the news today that the OnePlus 10PRO also uses the JN1 super wide  angle , but the Zhange broke the news that it is the outsole super wide  angle . Do you believe in others or in the Zhange , zhange is the most accurate , without  one ofPuzzled  I really hope it is not JN1 Cheap and gimmicky , how nice You should have the answer in your heart , do nt resist It s so annoying , the photography has been downgraded , speechless Here is a surprise  allow sadness   allow sadness  I went to see the 12pro yesterday . Although it feels good in the hand , the texture is still much worse than that of the 11u . The black edge of the chin is also larger than that of the 11u . Overall , the 11u is still very strong . The texture of the 12pro is better , the processor , temperature control , camera experience , and feel , the 12pro is better than the 11u , and the 11u is stronger in telephoto waterproof . Everyone feels different , I still like 11U I like telephoto , so I also prefer 11U  Yun Bei  I feel that the workmanship 12pro is on a higher level , but the texture has to be ceramic  doge  My 11u back cover can insert paper  allow sad  Hahahahaha , gentle like jade 11ultra is highly recognizable , and 12Pro seems a little too young . Waterproof is gone  handshake  correct Apple photography is still okay , and taking pictures is okay , but it s not the strongest wave as if you know everything He at least knows better than you . Well , he is your father The photography is the strongest , many people like the taking pictures , it seems to be easier to ps Invincible for close  up shots , suck for long  range I wo nt buy Apple for the next mobile phone , the power is lost quickly , and I got stuck out when I play games  Yun Bei  Every time I play with others , I ca nt play for a long time . 50 Free Shipping  DOGE  There s an extra zero  doge  Add an extra zero because of you  doge  But apple is smooth Can only be said to be general . The screen is poor , and the touch screen experience is extremely bad . When playing games , if you answer the phone , you ll be stuck out 100  . But very smooth This Huawei screen is still whitewashed by someone , laughing to death  Jerry  I just said that XR is not as good as Huawei , but I did nt say that Huawei is good , please do nt assume it s about you That s really my misunderstanding . Who use XR really do nt have the right to scold Huawei s screen , but Huawei s screen is also very rubbish  laugh haha  It s mainly because you are more good at nonsense , Samsung s large curved screen is also green , so Samsung has reduced the curvature The surface is green , do nt you understand ? I suggest you take compulsory education Why is the green border of the LG screen controlled so well ? Go to the Internet to search for the comparison between Zhou Dongyu screen and LG screen . Mixed use of lottery has poor quality control . Do nt pretend that you understand everything on the Internet , and you can only say  The curved screen turns green .  I m holding the lg , and it s also green at this angle . Would you like to show it to you ? My dad s previous Samsung is also like this  Khan  Is nt this the way the curved screen looks from this angle ? It s terrible . Blue Green Factory and Low Yao are all machine crowd tactics . Glory only sent two more than monkeys  Yunbei  Why do nt you say that the total number of Xiaomi s parent brands and sub  brands is only 21 , while the number of Honor alone is 23 , and there are many stupid machine , as well as the thousand yuan machine 720P water drop screen LCD  laughing  Do nt buy Honor mobile phones , there is no cost  effective , and quality control is not good  Blue and green at least have quality control Glory is all purchased from suppliers , right ? Are the V40 series , 50 series , and play series released in the second half of the year ? Anyway , redmi will not give you something good on photography , just right Got it , K50 is still imx582  dogedoge  Never use IMX686  Laughing without saying  Do you still remember the K30Pro that took good pictures but sold poorly  doge   Wang Teng hints that Redmi ca nt take good pictures  This is clearly shown  Doge  Very good , looking forward to it iPhone 6s is still stuck now , the battery is aging and charging is slow , unable to keep up with the trend You tell me , is there any kind of battery that will not age after a long time , I will buy it 3,000 yuan Android , no problem to does nt get stuck in a year or two , 10,000 yuan can be changed three times , the appearance and function are better , iphone is really nothing good except ios now I m dying of laughter , compare the 6sp with the current Android , you will know when you buy a new Apple model and use it Change the battery and resurrect with full blood  two ha  My 6sp does nt have screen fingerprints , it does nt keep up with the times when taking pictures , and charging is slow By the way , how about iqoo  DOGE  Note 6 was really awesome back then  The photo and appearance are pretty good , and it has the classic CPU Snapdragon 625  allow sad  625 is classic CPU?Yun Bei  Erha  625 is recognized as the classic CPU . Look at how many machines were equipped with it back then , and the power consumption is very balanced . 625 , I m surprised , Meilan has such a good CPU ? Meizu X depressed  School Season  I also have a Meilan X , just bought it for that screen , but unfortunately the processor is too bad I still have  laughing cry  Holding 11u said , damn 888 , what a good configuration is wasted on this fire dragon , I dare not use it outdoors in summer My sister s 11u has a problem with the fixed focus when taking pictures . It always freezes . After my 11pro was burned , I changed it to 70pp and it felt a lot worse ... I think it s okay to take pictures , the first  class level , but it s too hot ... In addition , how do you feel about 70pro , is there a big improvement when taking pictures compared to 11p ? It will arrive tomorrow , 11pro photos are garbage , it does nt even have a macro , my sister s is not good at focusing , but mine ca nt focus at all .... Do nt blame 888 , Xiaomi s tuning is also poor Normal use of Huawei is also hot , maybe the first one is hot To be honest , the workmanship and texture of the k40 G are great The texture of the K40 G is good , and the Dimensity 1200 is also good . Anyway , playing game is more stable than my 888 . But the screen sucks . It has a green edge when I bought it , but it is only used to play games at home instead of 11U , so I did not return it . Straight screen with green edge ?  doge  My classmate s is not bad , there is no green edge , but the permeability of the domestic screen is indeed not as good as that of the Samsung screen You also believe in the green edge of the straight screen ?  eat melon  Are you serious ? I saw Xiaobai holding the k40 G Bruce Lee and the dawn of GT , but the Bruce Lee version was beaten on the ground and even could nt get up . I m talking about the texture and workmanship . GT that smell of plastic , how to talk about texture And , you are also using a plastic frame now , how can you be qualified to laugh at GT ? At least GT is positioned higher than your machine Laughing to death , my friend bought a k40 g for a week and the volume button dropped  laugh cry  This is the workmanship How about Nubia s system  doge  Now it can be said that it is very good . It was bad before , but it was directly replaced by ZTE s system . Let me tell you this , it has all the functions it should have like small windows and split screen . Except for the voice assistant , other functions are very good . There are even some bells and whistles that other phones do nt have . Nubia s previous systems were better than ZTE s , which used to have fewer functions . Both are now more advanced . Split screen , small window , Nubia is the first batch of Android phones has these functions . We used to say that the system is poor , but I do nt think it s not good to use . The main reason is that the previous processor was too bad , and the rise of the Hua mi om system later . In addition , Nubia has not updated the system for a long time in those years . In fact , the current ZTE Nubia , the system is good and smooth , and the network is stable . Awesome The update is still very diligent . This is the Android version , which is earlier than others , especially Xiaomi . I was ripped off by Nubia Z11 back then , the system is really rubbish  It was like this back then , I do nt believe it can be better now  The system is said to be outsourced . Z17 s system is also very bad I have nt dared to use Android since the z11 rip me up , I m really scared Wo nt work better than mainstream systems Same xs max , but I want to change it , I still bought it in 2019 The same , I plan to buy  doge  I placed an order yesterday for 128 g Pro max sierra blue  hee hee  will arrive on the 24th But my mother scolded me  doge  Mine is xs , ready to order 13p I do nt see much improvement this year , so I m a little hesitant The high refresh rate of 120 Hz is not an improvement ? A movie  level camera . I also bought it in 2019 . Now it s alright . I ve always been more thrifty . I guess I ll use it for one or two more years .  allow sad  I switched from Xiaomi Mi 10pro , the phone is not stuck Is 12 much better than 10pro ? The charging is fast and the photos are good . Because the system is the same , there is not much difference in actual use . OK So this problem is quite confused  Yun Bei   Yun Bei  Mobile phone stuck is the problem of metaphysics I also changed from 10pro , and it does nt get stuck  doge  . It s too metaphysical . Xiaomi 11U , let s not say anything else , taking pictures is indeed good . Mine is also Xiaomi 11U , just changed  school season  How much did you buy ? A little over five thousand Honestly , at least in p50p , x70p , 11u , 13pm , 11u is really bad except for telephoto , mainly because the optimization is not very good Just win in blind test Yes , yes , vivox70p and 13pm both won  laughing  junk phone beat the one in your hand Last year s OnePlus 8pro users , the borders cut hands , and I do nt know where the texture came from . Oneplus bezel cut hands ? Did you buy a defective one ? It s not the only one people said that the 8pro border cut hands , and the volume keys are cut too . It s really not good . I agree with the volume button cutting hands , But in terms of borders , I see that everyone is complimenting , I have never heard the words of cutting hands , At least mine is very smooth , which can be comparable to the iphone .  Hug  Bro , me too , I changed to Xiaomi Mi 11 later  Yunbei  I m talking about the texture and accessories . Oneplus s line quality is okay , the charging head feels okay , too , and that Xiaomi this year is not bad for wireless charging , the new bluetooth headset is also good , not excellent , but it has improved So Apple is not good at taking pictures while video is good , Huawei is good at taking pictures while video is not good , so is there any good for both  Fat Red Smile  Samsung , both are good Samsung s photography is not good , just the experience is good Whether from evaluation or my own experience , Samsung s flagship camera is the best After thinking about it , it s really Samsung  Yunbei  and Samsung does nt use video chips like Mi OV . So wait for the s22u video  doge  Samsung , although the sharpening is serious , but it is really good  looking Indeed , MIUI12.5 is really the same as  Mix4 s 12.5.7 passed by , and I have nt encountered any bugs . The most frequent occurrence is that the animation of adjusting the brightness bar disappears in dark mode I regret that I bought the 11U on impulse , it is heavy and hot , and the hand feel is not as good as the MIX4 . Every time I buy a flagship , I have to be stabbed in the back  Erha  11u has 2k , it is estimated that the fever is more severe , although I never opened 2k when I used the last oneplus 7p  doge  11ultra s 12.5 is not good ? t s too general . MIUI10 and MIUI11 were much better in terms of fluency and stability at the time . Coupled with this year s Qualcomm 888 , I really could nt stand , so I bought it for heat dissipation and taking pictures . I think it s completely OK for taking pictures . but the heat dissipation really no different from a single copper tube pressing the i9 , it s really hot How many degrees ? How many degrees are you using it in ? My God , the 12.5 enhanced version is really smooth , and there are no bugs , do nt smear it From the Xiaomi 8th Anniversary flagship . Coincidentally , I have it too , I changed back to MIUI11 , smear it ? Look at what phone I m using , Mi Fan do nt lie to your family , you re still using my phone from three years ago , brother My wife uses 10S , 12.5 enhanced version , there are no bugs , it is stable and smooth . My own Mi 8 , 12.5 , is not only stable , but also saves power . The bright screen time is about 7 hours , and the battery is 3400 . Really awesome Personally , I feel that the four curved surfaces are really ugly and uncoordinated . This year , 12 will definitely be a little bit more moderate , but it will allow more people to accept it . However , the 11u s back cover design is really unique , and it looks really good .  the 11u s back cover design is really unique , and it looks really good  ...... Not so much  Let s just say it s a little unique  It s really domineering , it s okay for men to use domineering , it s good This is indeed . It s just that Xiaomi s work is bad , you think it s ugly Yes , Huawei p40pro did a good job , and the Xiaomi Mi 11 series failed to imitate . The R angle is not handled properly , it will be better to wear the case 855 can also hold 60 Why ca nt my OnePlus 8 T be stable , it freezes when I hit a group Are you still boasting about the ultimate stable frame rate ? It s just to reduce the performance . the heat is not high , but the performance is not high , too . Very bad , regardless of old users My 865 , the low image quality is stable at 90 has no problem , the high image quality will drop some during group fight Mi 10 extreme 90 frames can run at full frame , occasionally dropping one or two frames The 855 has four a76 cores , and the game the Honor of Kings only needs two a76 cores to stabilize 60 frames . The battery of the phone is dead after a long time use . The system locks performance . I have been using this for two and a half years now , and I have unloaded the honor of kings , which is not easy to measure . However , when playing Game For Peace , the frame drops are visible to the naked eye  Game For Peace is smooth by default , that is , the lowest picture quality , frame rate is 60  . Although the optimization of lightspeed is not good , it will get stuck when there are too many people . However , when searching for materials in ordinary scenes , frames will be dropped from time to time . The experience is rather poor If the girl likes to play games and take pictures ...  allow sadness   allow sadness   allow sadness  Buy neo5  doge  . Game and photography both is strong The front camera is not good , the girl wants to take a selfie  allow sad  Buy reno5p if you need a selfie , the 865 processor is no different from the 870  doge  Glimmer  Xiaomi  Redmi , complementary advantages Do you have to bring two mobile phones ?  Yun Sad  Save to buy a power bank  doge  Redmi is a straight male machine Not so absolutely Is it to use price to benchmark ?  dig nose  But this 12 experience is really OK The mobile phone is not used for one day , can it be used for a few years and still be smooth ? Xiaomi ride the wave of Apple every day , and it can only brag . The core technology is not good , everything is useless . What is the core of Apple s mobile phone ? system ? The problem is no telephoto and 512 g  doge  Make way for Xiaomi 12U I m still a little hesitant to buy 12 or 12p , I want to replace the Mi 10 It is recommended to go offline to experience first , buy the comfortable one . I have experienced it , I am still a bit tangled Daily use , 12 . Need extreme performance , pro If you want to feel good , 12 , if you want better configuration , pro Big Pro better Apple is about to be eliminated   What era is it ? Attack others about the mobile phone they use ? Use what we like , do nt need your blah blah The fact is that most people with social status use Huawei , only the poor take loans to buy Apple in installments  Apple is used by the poor to pretend . I see a lot of wealthy people on Weibo are from Apple , right ? Casually speaking , Ma Yun and Qin Fen seem to be using Apple . The phone you are using shows that you really have no money . That s just your ignorance Now this big environment really still wants to use Apple , at least dont need to worry about it . Android update too fast Huawei is only good at 5 g , does the 4000mAh battery really last longer than Apple ? Apple standby for eight hours without losing any battery , and the comprehensive battery life is much stronger than Android , and the battery is smaller The problem with Apple is that the signal is not good , and there is nothing wrong with other places . It s alright , the signal is not as bad as said on the Internet , I feel that the call quality is clearer than Android Is there a situation where the signal is full but the message can not be sent ? My classmates bought the iPhone 4 before , it also beat the vivo I bought this year  Yunbei  Yours are a mobile phone with a few hundred yuan that can be  beaten  by the iPhone 4 ten years ago . Do nt you know the progress of science and technology , which of the various hardware in ten years is not stronger by a few grades . My mobile phone is very stuck when playing games . The iPhone 4 that my classmate bought in elementary school is not stuck . The battery life of the game is longer than my vivo  Grass Mud Horse  That is indeed outrageous I ca nt even tell if you re fishing or something ... Apple 4 , let alone smooth , some games now ca nt run at all ... They ca nt even run , how to be smooth ... Do nt buy vivo when you buy a mobile phone , typical high price with low configuration Android s small screen is all courting death , all of them Xiaomi CVCI successfully proves that not everyone likes big screen phones Is civi a small screen ? It s thin and light , and I like thin and light , but the small screen they said is like 6.1 inches . Whoever makes that kind in Android will die , and the post will be the proof . Do you have mochi ? divide and eat Not necessarily , the premise of making a small screen without failure is to find a CPU that can be used with low power consumption and heat , plus a good screen . However , the Android small screen is a pseudo  demand . Many people say they want a small screen , but it is not for a small screen , but for a low  priced flagship . The price can not exceed the price of iphone se . The problem is that many small  screen followers just like the flagship processor without considering the heat dissipation and the power consumption , Otherwise why are they clamoring for the flagship of the small screen ?  Yun Sad  9se died quite miserably with 712 ... Former 9se users , the problem is not on 712 . The hand feel is really good , but the jumping screen is really unpopular , and there is no version with high memory and memory , the space is not enough so I replaced my machine . The feel is actually quite comfortable Xiaomi 6  Doge  ? Is there any of blue green factory ? The OPPO R11s I bought in early January of 2018 is here . The 64 G memory is too small and not enough , so I have uninstalled a lot of software . If I often play , then charge twice a day , without play when I m busy , charge once a day . Hahaha the exactly same mobile phone is still holding up and will change it during the Chinese New Year  allow sad   allow sad  I m also thinking about changing , but I have nt figured out what to change . In those days , blue  green did not have a true  flagship  to took the route of high price with low configuration . Although the price is high and the configuration is low , it seems to be some great machine . I do nt remember it very much . During that time , Blue and Green rarely used the Snapdragon 8XX . Oppo findx , I have used it for two or three years , and it does nt get stuck , but the battery has suddenly dropped very quickly these days . I do nt know how long it can last  tears  Change the battery and keep working ACE dumps GT ten streets gt is ace Just a fake name Indeed , GT and ACE gaps are too large Yes , GT is not worthy of the title of ACE , and it is even not worthy to work for ACE .  Allow sad  To put it simply , if you compare with this year s flagship machine , the positioning of ACE is at least 11u , findx3Pro , x60Pro in this year s positioning  Erha  It s not that high , maybe it s about Mi 11 , or find x3 at most . I do nt think it s good for ace to take pictures The positioning is really so high , the ACE photography is really not very good , but there were no many have good camera that year , only a few have optical image stabilization , ACE also has a 2x optical change , the photography can not be ranked in the top 3 , but the top 10 is no problem . Looking at the models in 2019 , except for the OnePlus 7Pro and the OnePlus 7TPro can beat the ACE , which other models can ? Which of the 19  year  old flagships of Mi 9Pro and nex3 can compete with ACE ? The p30 Pro can only win in photography They are all a family , there is no need to hurt each other No need for that , it s too big  This year 13Pro is not worse than max . Who can stand a brick , even the Pro has become heavier  bitter  I used to be a staunch supporter of 6s and x , but after I bought the 12p at first launch , the battery life became bad after half a year . It did nt take long for me to start worrying about the battery when I go out . For the sake of battery life , I have to endure the volume and weight , and I want to buy a max . In this case , max does have an advantage in battery power , but I personally think that this year s Pro is more worthwhile . After all , you bought a Pro when the Pro was slightly inferior last year . Hahaha . My battery is also very bad now , it did nt affect my daily life when it was 100 . Now it s 92  bitter  To solve the problem of battery life , I have tried the back clip battery and it is not bad , but the charging logic is not very good , and it is too expensive . In conclusion , if you want battery life , buy max  laughing  To tell you the truth , mine was already only 91 healthy in April  cracked  , and then it start falling apart . Indeed , last year the max camera was somewhat different than the pro , this year is the same except for the screen , right ?  Bitterness   I really want to see how powerful this year s max battery life can be  two ha  The pro is already very heavy Same prepare to change from 12 pm to 13pro I still prefer the current 5000  80W combination  DOGE  Useless , Apple beats all Android models with 3300 battery life Because Apple is 60Hz  2 Ha  13pro3095 battery is also more durable than Android 4500  5000  doge  Yes  allow sadness   allow sadness   allow sadness  as long as the charging speed is not too slow , and then has a 5000 large battery . 4500 is not enough You have to find out .. 4500 is paired with 150W super flash charge .. 12 minutes to charge it full is not enough ? Even a 1000W battery that is not as cool as a 5000mah battery . I never bring a charger or power bank when I go out . It would be better if there is a 5000  120w combination  doge  150W6000mAh battery is better  hahahahahaha  Wait , there will always be  doge  Kirin came and killed all  doge  Kirin enjoys the benefits of a77 , g77 and TSMC s 5 nm . Now it must use arm x architecture . Even if it is designed by Kirin , it will not be much better . Do nt deify manufacturers . 4A710 is not bad , right ? Then it will suffer a lot in scenarios that require single  core performance , such as software opening speed , etc . After all , the a710 ca nt compare to the x2 when it is fully loaded with a single core . It should be said that the difference between a710 and x2 at the beginning of design determines the different application scenarios between them Do nt brag about Kylin , the same public version , you ca nt build a big cache Kirin is supported by Huawei s strong optimization strength . Other brands ca nt use it well . Huawei can  doge   Laughing Cry   Laughing Cry   Laughing Cry  Are you serious ? Kirin also uses ARM , it should be that Apple kills all But Apple is too slow to charge  Yun Bei  I heard that the next generation , charging and cooling have been strengthened  dogedoge  According to several media , the battery life of the 13 Pro is not as good as that of the 13 , and the screen flicker is more serious How big is the strobe difference between 13 and 12PM ? If there is not much difference , I will buy 13 . After all , it is a bit troublesome to buy 12PM now About the same , but the 12PM screen is better overall It seems that I have to buy 12 pm , it is a bit stupid to spend 8k to buy a brand new one now 13 is not as good as pro ? Is it so exaggerated ? Is it the other way around ?  laughs cry  Is the folding screen can be called not bad ? Worse too much . It ca nt compare with anyone at present . It should nt be included in the mix or even ruined the mix4 . The mix4 itself is very powerful during under the screen , and it was lowered by folding . I think it s okay to use it , it s not worth only 50 points , is it that bad ? Use it before you say The crease is relatively obvious , and the external screen ratio is unreasonable . I have not used it , but I went to the store to experience it . I just feel that it is inappropriate to classify it into the mix . It put the mix4 really embarrassed . Pursue high  end , but it makes people feel that the mix is not good , so that the mix4 ca nt go up and down , and it hurts the brand , not good Still a brand problem Compared with oppo , it s too bad to be comparable . Whether it is system operation or appearance design , this one of Xiaomi makes people has no intention to buy it . How to say , mix4 and fold should not belong to the mix series , the original 3 was a mistake , it s already very conscientious that cheat us once a yeardoge   doge  Come on , at least Apple wo nt make a rubbish emperor , and many domestic flagships are more expensive than the 13 . There are few hedges better than him . Who else will discuss or remember the Android flagship of the year of the iPhone 13 in 3 years ? Picture comment  Laughs without saying a word  Ah , no need , ip13pro is the most smooth and stable mobile phone at present , I changed it from Mi 11u . Although the Xiaomi Mi 11u can be 120hz globally , it has high heat generation and power consumption , and the software quality of Android is not as good as that of ios . A night mode Miui that some software is not adapted , the font and background are very uncomfortable when the night mode is forced Chives will grow whether they are cut or not , so it is best to wait for a year to grow taller  doge  Even if the apple play somebody for a sucker , the person who can at least take out more than 5,000 mate40pro plus Hongmeng system , really easy to use  good  Can the King of Glory account still be used after changing the system ? Hahaha , can Can the p40 be upgraded ? I see that your page is good , and I want to have it , too Ca nt buy it , and the price of scalpers is too expensive . I really want to have a mate40 or mate40pro  two hatwo hatwo ha  The desktop of Hongmeng system looks good  doge   Dig nose   Dig nose   Dig nose  , I can only see The mate30 bought in 2019 is also very easy to use Hongmeng System YYDS I do nt understand the mentality of recommending Xiaomi to people . Xiaomi is very good , the camera and screen is very good Not suitable for ordinary people , endless bug  Yun Bei  Nonsense , die laughing I do nt understand the mentality of recommending the iPhone to the Chinese .  doge  What s the difference ?  doge  all is the same Is the realme GT Exp . Master Edition easy to use , what are the disadvantages , bro , I want to buy  doge  I do nt understand what NC can say that  doge  Jumping after being poked at the pain point ? There is always someone who acts as a manufacturer  Boss Lei is the biggest puffer of xiaomi . Xiaomi Mi 10 has a large gap in the back cover , burns the motherboard , Xiaomi Mi 11 burns wifi , and 12 burns what ? 11pro has been used for half a year , and the wifi is burned  two ha  The Mi 10 I bought also burned the motherboard for two months . I was thinking of Xiaomi s first high  end flagship , and I was ready to support it . I did nt expect to encounter this situation . Xiaomi s flagship is really not good . Xiaomi focuses on e  waste . The Xiaomi charger I bought has been charging leakage for half a year . The interface of the power bank has poor contact within three months . It was originally , born for fever , there is nothing wrong with it  meow  Before the launch of Xiaomi mobile phone , awesome  after the launch , the garbage  doge  The hand feel is hard to say , some people like thin and light , some people like thick , there is a sense of presence My friend said that a little heavier has a texture , and expensive mobile phones are heavier . .  Yunbei  I was speechless I also feel that it is better to be a little heavier , but it should be less than 210 g. If it is heavier , it will feel like fall . Too light will feels like plastic . I think thin and light is a little more comfortable , but stacking materials , batteries and thin and light can not have both  laugh cry  The feel is still Meizu . Although there are many problems with the mobile phone , the feel is really good  Er Ha  Yes , Meizu 18 does not say anything else , the feel and texture are invincible , but Pro has no highlights I ve been using 7p for a few years and I have nt seen a time when there is no signal . Apple s poor signal is already a consensus in the industry . You can buy another brand with good signal and compare it to know , such as Huawei Samsung . You can measure the received signal strength in the same area , the signal of the underground parking lot , and the time from disconnection to re  searching the network . But I have used it for three years , one year in Yantai , one year in a small county , and one year in Shanghai . At any daily life scene does not affect the experience of use . Is nt that enough ? What s the point of comparing this ?  Cracked  But others also think that Android is enough for daily use . Can you think that , but ca nt others think ? Ah yes yes  two ha  The distinguished coaxing user has the best signal  two ha  No , no , bug ui is the most honored  Tears   Tears   Tears  Die of laughter , it is well known that if the iPhone has problems , either the operator s problem or the user s problem , how can there be a problem with the phone  haha  After using so many mobile phones , the Apple experience is actually the best  haha  Xiaomi 12pro has been used for two days , the battery life is really bad  tears  , the experience is also average It s okay , let s get the curve out I ca nt put the comments , I sent a private letter  love you  Smear only for smear ? You can buy it and try it , this is the real feeling I use , 7 years of Mi fan . Fortunately , I held back and got a tablet 5PRO  allow sad  Jilao , I would like to ask , I used iphone 13pro , mi 11 , 11ultra , mi 12 , I can only send WeChat on the subway , it did nt work even if I want to check my  Moments  , there is no Internet . But I can surf the Internet at high speed with my spare machine sharp r2c , what s the problem ? Is it better to switch to Huawei ? My OnePlus 9Pro has poor signal in the office area , and there is often no Internet access . The signal of my colleagues  iPhone 11 and X is also not good . Later , I changed to Huawei mate40 , surprisingly the 5 G signal was full . Also I got a first MotoX30 which signal is between the two . I have to say that Huawei s signal is invincible . I want to rent one and try it  doge  If the signal is good , I will consider changing it okay . But is there no one use it around ? Take a look and experience it , then you can know  hee hee  Is it China Unicom Card  dogedogedoge  Shenzhen Unicom Card is famous It is indeed Unicom  Tears  The mobile signal of the entire Shenzhen Metro is not good , the source is the operator I recommend you buy it , but even kill me and I do nt buy it My own 7pro , which has been used for more than two years , is currently very smooth . I replaced it with a new battery and continued to fight for another year . Oh yes , 10pro personally do not recommend it  doge  Does the 7Pro not burn the screen ? It s amazing , this one of mine has nt burned yet  Yunbei  Meizu is reversed , I want me to buy it myself , I do nt recommend it  Yun Bei  The person who bought it  sad  is a one  shot deal  Chunyou Family  CIVI also has no bug  cute  The civi system is already so bad , still brag it ? Go to search the actual measurement . Some people always think that system optimization is not a cost , software engineers do not need wages , and mobile phones only need to stack materials . I use it myself , do nt I know better than you ?  pick nose  How is the battery life ? I ve been a little heartbeat recently , cool guy pink  doge  Xiaomi s civi has nothing to do with my red rice  doge  The mid  to  low end includes the mid  end  doge  and it has been repaired when civi comes out 22 is too flat , 22  feels very bad I would like to call the front of the s22 the most beautiful model at present  meow   personal  Xperia 1iii looks the best Already used ? The s22 and  have the same material and workmanship , should nt they feel about the same ? Size , weight ... S22  very comfortable to use I feel bad in hand , far worse than 21   Then drag the blue factory designer out  Yunbei  Die of laughter , obviously the second one is in line with the inherited design characteristics of Xiaomi ultra , and it can also avoid being accused of plagiarism by friend business , but he chose the first one , the blue factory is so smart  too happy   too happy   too happy   The second one fits ? The core of the 11u design is symmetry . The secondary screen was added for the sake of symmetry . Like the second one , it is placed on the left , what does it fit ? Symmetrical what ? It s just for recognition , and the secondary screen is also for clearing the inventory of the bracelet . NEX 3 is a ring , how do you say that ? The ring does nt matter , mainly because I think the design is not very good  looking , but it still depends on the final product . The blue factory has been looking good in recent years . No , it s hard to say , if the blue factory is flattened , maybe it will look good Gn1 is flat , the square piece , emmm , seems to be a way to flatten  thinking  So who is better than 11u in taking pictures ?  Yunbei  vivo X70 Pro is the strongest Telephoto 11ultra is better , portrait vivo is better The telephoto is sure that Xiaomi is stronger . Which one is more eye  catching , the scenery or the food ? Not the strongest , the 11u telephoto yyds , in addition to Xiaomi s algorithm is poor , x70Pro color reproduction and night glare suppression is good OV mobile phone color reproduction is good  allow sad  Ah , are you sure the color reproduction is good ? Obviously , you are a cloud user , The vivo I have used , the color sharpening is too serious The upper limit is really high , but the lower limit is also low X80Pro s performance does not need to be worried , 9000 is okay In terms of images alone , which one is stronger , X80Pro or NEX5 ? Do nt ignore the NEX5 , the image of the NEX5 is also very strong , it should be close to the X80 Pro NEX is not under the screen , right ? Last year , x70pp also used 888plus , but the charging speed and game performance are really bad  I feel that the blue factory has given too many images to the x series , and it is really not enough for the performance  Well , the X70 Pro pursues thinness and lightness , and it is not as good as the iQOO series in terms of gaming experience . 13pro feels stuck , then you will be get stuck to crazy if you use Android and Hongmeng phones It s true , the application will occasionally freeze , and some need to exit directly , the most obvious is the drop  down search . I do nt know what s going on with you , I ve been smooth at 13pm , never stuck 13 will drop frames , and killing the background is also very serious . There is no one like this for a 6000 yuan mobile phone . It s because of the system . Wechat messages have not been received on time , and other software will occasionally get stuck . It is true ... The response speed of the mobile phone ca nt keep up with my hand speed  two ha   two ha  I experienced the Xiaomi Mi 12pro offline , it feels so refined 12 feel even more excellent  allow sad  Yes , but it is slightly thicker . It ca nt compare to my 18 , but other places have improved a lot . Prep 618 buy 12x Is 12x screen better than 10s ? The 12pro is more textured than the 12 , but I still prefer the 12 s small size  doge  I think 12 is the best looking , the pro camera is wider and it does nt look good But the camera module of 12pro is metal texture , 12 is a bit plastic . I went to see it , indeed , the be zel gaps are better than the Mi 11 In the past , when Huawei used k3v2 , Qualcomm expressed its willingness to sell it to Huawei at a cheaper price than selling it to other mobile phone manufacturers , hoping that Huawei would not develop its own . But without independent research and development , the future is really uncertain . Whether to supply and whether to increase the price depends on others . Take a look at the price increase of domestic mobile phones this year . It can be seen . In this way , I think it is a good deal to buy Samsung , Apple and Huawei . The brand is there , the performance is there , and the texture is there . But there is no way . Huawei terminals are now faced with whether there are mobile phone chips available . If Huawei executives do not realize what you are talking about , the Kirin 990 will not appear . But now if Qualcomm is allowed to sell to Huawei , Huawei can only act by chance There is no other way , in order to maintain the mobile phone business , which accounts for a large share of the consumer business , it can only do this first . Expedient . Hope we can develop better in the future From the k3v2 of the year to the current 990 5 G , I have been witnessing the growth of Huawei . It s not easy , to tell the truth . really Only when we are strong and keep doing basic research well is the foundation of our future . Those gadgets are named what black technology . Really ca nt take it to the table . Cheap is not a panacea , texture and brand appeal are not simply based on the configuration that you have , I have and everyone has . Brand image is important . Quick  X80PP is Dimensity ?  doge  Looking forward to 9000 x80pp 1 Fage is probably not very good at taking pictures , impossible What do you think the blue factory make the V1 chip for ? It is to not be restricted by the platform isp ?  Pick the nose  Is no one paying attention to Samsung s Orion ? It sucks , speechless , 9820 Yes If I want the software to be cold  started and not stuck , the camera can take pictures , and the bugs are less , can I only choose the iPhone ? The iPhone is not stuck , the old machine will load slowly  doge  The animation will also have insufficient frames It s okay , the response speed of my 6s is acceptable to me now  doge  It can still be used  doge  I have used both 11 and 12 , and I feel that 11 runs a little slower than 12 Huawei is also good , but the camera may not be able to shoot casually Right  doge  I never look at the quality of the pictures , I just want to take pictures casually , but there seems to be not much that can do this in Android . Apple is still strong at shooting casually  doge  Yes , shooting casually , the strongest one is Apple Xiaomi Mi 10pro , 10u is the true flagship , telephoto , good screen , big battery fast charge . Be bound to be a nail house 10U is too heavy Which flagship machine is not heavy ? iphone13 The 10u screen is very bad , much worse than the 10pro . But the color is good From the perspective of Xiaomi Home today , I do nt know if it is illusion , but the screen of the 11pro seems to be better than that of the 12pro . Now the weakened miui13 of 10u ca nt match the focus , the community has not yet dealt with it , and directly cast the spell  allow sad  I have been entangled in master exploration and gtneo2 , how should I choose between the two ? For daily use , taking pictures , and caring about the screen , choose the master to explore  for games , direct screen , and caring about battery life , choose neo2 Is the master reno 6p vest The two are not the same price , they are different in many ways The master explore is good at taking pictures , the gtneo2 has a large battery , and it is a little better to play games , but the gt master has a curved screen , and the gtneo2 has a straight screen Comprehensive , master exploration version  you mainly play games , neo2 Apple is really good except for being expensive .  likelikelike  In fact , I do nt think it s very expensive . Like Huawei , it s also very expensive . If you go to a mobile phone store , you can see that they all cost 3000 or 4000 yuan . My phone is also 4000 yuan . Please do nt buy it . I feel that the vivo sub  brand is the same as the more than 1,000 vivo cameras I took before . Although photography is indeed not the strength of this mobile phone , this mobile phone is still a lot of blur when taking pictures , Its pixels are not as high as the more than 1,000 vivo pixels on sale . How about the vivox series ? Want to change X80 or S22 If I do nt think the requirements are too high , it s okay to buy a thousand or two thousand vivo . It has been used for more than two years and it has not been repaired , but the third year it became frozen . I have also used Meizu , it s camera is ok . I went to the Xiaomi store , originally , I wanted to buy the 100MP 1599 from Xiaomi . Xiaomi has an original camera that also has its own beauty , which I do nt like very much . There is also one taking pictures yellow . You can go to the physical store and try it out . Then go online to buy , or buy what you are not satisfied with Except for the lack of texture in the design and the fact that the image is a year and a half behind the domestic production , Apple does not have any shortcomings  but these two points I ca nt bear  doge   No texture  laughing   laughing   laughing  Apple s ancestral 1200 , 10 years behind , Android is 100 million  hee hee  In 2022 , do nt say that notch has texture  black line   black line   black line  backward is backwardness Taking pictures sucks The new performance is very good compared to the previous  good  It s not serious , it s not hot all day to take pictures today . But Beijing is 5 degrees in the daytime today , so it ca nt get hot haha Compared to the iPhone ? I use Apple now , and I will support domestic production in the future . Apple video recording is still more stable , I think Apple is not as good as Android when taking pictures , and Apple is even worse than Android at night . In terms of video recording , there is really no Android phone that can compare with Apple . Haha ca nt get hot Um Is it true that the leftover A  screen is stronger than Zhou Dongyu ? Coincidentally , it is really better than Zhou Dongyu Screen arrangement decides everything ? Including color cast and viewing angle are definitely worse than others The ordinary movie queen screen is worse than the ordinary Samsung screen . Where can you buy the leftovers from Samsung ? Have you seen the Samsung screen of OnePlus 5 ? Now there are no bad leftovers in the market , the movie queen screen is worse a little bit , but other aspects like taking pictures are good is enough . Because of the same price machine , the drill row is stronger than Zhou Dongyu s The iPhone12pro is still more recommended than the iPhone13 , because it has 2 g more RAM , which is very important . 4 g RAM , even Sogou input method and other third  party input methods are often killed  two ha  Indeed , I feel that the difference between xr and 12p is too big , xr often kills the background , 12p wechat qq weibo post bar camera is still there after a circle . XR 3 GB RAM 12p battery life is too bad , worse than 12 , the frame will drop when playing games in summer I just changed from 12 to 12p . To be honest , the battery life of these two cameras is not much different , and it is similar when playing games , but the background improvement is really obvious  I changed it mainly because the 12 is too often to kill the background , and I am quite satisfied .  two ha  12P battery life is too bad If you want a 2k straight screen , there is Realme , and if you want a 2k small screen , there is Meizu . I want to see how the netizens choose this time  ErhaErhaErha  Xiaomi 12 screen is comparable to e4 , do nt buy it ? It was originally the Huaxing e4 , ok ? Huaxing e4 ? ? ? ? ? I m dying of laughter , E is the standard for Samsung screens , only Samsung screens are E  hahahahaha  Although I do nt have the money to buy it , I think Meizu is very good . Except for the poor processor , the other peripherals of the 18 do not lose at all . Except for the criticism of system maintenance and after  sales , you can buy it directly without considering it . Battery life charging and taking pictures are completely outdated Not many people will choose Meizu  allow sad  There is really has twill visible to the naked eye . The domestic screen should keep fighting Proud to use a foreign screen ? My eyes like the top screen , it does nt matter the manufacturer , but Samsung is the best at this stage , you have to accept it . Obviously BOE has a good screen , but Huawei does nt use it , I do nt understand Angry ? Huawei s Samsung flagship is better than Xiaomi s , regardless of workmanship and quality control . Do you think everyone is stupid with money but you are smart with less money ? The default is  smart resolution  mode , just turn it off in the settings .. In addition , the p40 screen has a higher ppi than the meter 10 , if you can see the twill on this screen ...  two ha  Time to wait for the evaluation . After all , it is a domestic A  screen , and it is already very good to be comparable to the Mi 10 . In fact , it is more intuitive to go directly to the store to compare . The quality of the screen of the P40 is not bad , it is very delicate , but the color is not as good as that of the Xiaomi Mi 10 . You can check it out for yourself in the store . I feel like my M20 can fight for more few more years  hahahahahaha  I m also an M20 , I do nt need to say about the smoothness , but the shortcomings are obvious , the charging is slow , and sometimes the charging is hot . I do nt know if yours has this phenomenon . The original fast charge is fast and does nt heat up . Is your battery dying ? Mine is the original fast charge . It was normal until I upgraded to Hongmeng , but this happened after I upgraded it . Just upgrade , it feels smooth . What should I do with my mate10 ? My Xiaomi Mi 9 ca nt hold it anymore I also just changed to 12 . I play games occasionally , and temporarily feel that the battery life , performance , and smoothness are not bad . Will it be hot Daily use , cold , the game has not been played yet , I can test it I changed the k30s from Xiaomi 9 , I have no motivation to change it  sad  Friends just changed from 9 to 12 , and felt very good . Remarks , he does not play mobile games Bought note20ultra yesterday  Yun Sad  865  The value of note20u is too outrageous  allow sadness   allow sadness  this time last year was also at this price  allow sadness   allow sadness  Who said Samsung was the diving champion ?  Yun sad  What was the price last year ? It is also more than 5,000 , and now it is still more than 5,000  allow sad  I want to buy it too , mine is s20  now , is it necessary ?  laugh cry   laugh cry  Wait , before the minimum 5099  12 period interest  free , it ca nt be brought now , I do nt know if it will drop to this price again February 2nd ? Why have I never seen this price  tears   tears  In recent years , which iPhone has not been stuck ? the speed of opening software , and the speed of response , anyone who has experienced it dares to say that it is smooth ? In short , it is touted for no reason . Is this flattering ? My i7 has been used for four years and it still responds quickly and smoothly , why do nt you think that there is a problem with the way you use it  question  The xsmax has been used for two years , the battery is not good , play the glory of the king is hot , the screen is occasionally stuck , and the signal is even worse . My friend s Android machine , it s been two years , nothing but insufficient memory I do nt play games , except the battery is not that good , I have nt found any shortcomings so far I have been using Apple since 2015 and now I have used an X for 3 years , how come I have never encountered the situation you mentioned  doge  That s alright , maybe I bought smuggled goods , maybe only mine will get stuck . I started using apple from the 4s , and now I m using the 11pro , and it never get stuck . Only when the beta version of ios15 was updated last time , crashes once while playing the game , and it was just fine to update to the official version WPS has to be opened twice each time . Face unlock is really not as fast as fingerprints , and signal and camera are not as good as Huawei . Is there any mobile phone that can be bought now , which is better for playing games ?  tears  Especially the price  performance ratio is good , 3000 budget  tears   tears  Mate40 is a perfect machine  DOGE  3000 budget  Laughing without saying  k40  doge   doge   doge  1500 The 870 machine should be good for playing games , such as k40 , the cost  effective is good Really have to choose 870 ? I m afraid it wo nt last long  Yun Sad  Nothing , my 980 nova5pro is still very stable . It s hard to drop frames . Neo5s , it s really good . How about taking pictures ? I used Neo5 before , the battery life is not good , but camera is okay . The updated version should be fine . But it does nt affect Huawei s mobile phone screen . Although there is high frequency pwm , it is Zhou Dongyu arrangement , although there is high frequency pwm  doge  It is recommended to take a look at the Honor 60pro , the diamond  like arrangement and high  frequency PWM . If you have time , go online to know the latest news . They said Huawei  eat melon  Huawei mate9pro 2 K Samsung flexible screen , mate10 2 K LCD screen , mate 10 pro and mate 30 standard Samsung 1080P screen , mate20 1080PLCD screen , mate 30pro Samsung flexible screen , P10pro 2 K LCD , P20 1080PLCD , P20pro P30 1080P Samsung screen , there are so many good screens you ca nt see , you are blind  question   Yunbei  In the past , BOE also had a good screen , why not use it ? What kind of good screen was the previous BOE ? The previous screen of Black Shark 3Pro was good in the same period The new version of mate x2 and the subsequent batches of mate40pro have changed the arrangement ... It did nt change the arrangement , still Zhou Dongyu , but it was replaced by new Zhou  eat melon  12 signal is pretty good You may not play PUBG ... and there is no application scenario of subway and underground garage ... The subway is okay , everyone is the same in the underground garage  Er Ha  No ... try Huawei ... Full signal ...  Tears  Are you Sure sure Hi dami , I have a question I want to ask you . I saw the review before saying that the sound quality of the Xiaomi Mi 10s is very good . I would like to ask if the volume of 10s is louder than other mobile phones when the volume is turned to the maximum ? My mother s hearing is not very good . I want to give her a phone with a louder volume . There is no requirement for sound quality . The volume is more important . Thank you , can you give me an answer ? It is recommended to give your mother a bracelet , the news vibration is really useful My mother can notice the news , just the volume of the mobile phone was relatively low before , and her hearing was not good , so she often could nt hear the video clearly . This time I change for her mainly to make it more convenient for her to make video calls and watch videos  love you  Xiaomi Mi 10 users tell you that it is very loud and really cool  doge  I feel that the volume of the Mi 10 is not as loud as that of the K40 . Yes , when my 11u sound was turned to the maximum , my sister said it was an elderly machine  two ha  100 million pixels , I think it s pretty cool You two Xiaomi 10S users should unify the opinions  Yun Bei  I changed from Xiaomi Mi 10 to 11pro , and after 10  day experience , it was too bad , hot , and poor battery life   screen is really good  , then change to 10s  screen is bad  I changed from Xiaomi 10 pro to find x2 pro , the same 865 , the green factory s is much smoother , the plain leather version will not get hot , the 10 pro was very hot , let s see how the miui13 is It s really clear , but the camera turns on slow and the image is slow Come on , it s useless at all , the Mi 10 is too bad for taking pictures ? ? To be honest , I feel that the 10 s lens arrangement is a bit better than the 11 s ... But there is a problem with 10 . Fingers are easy to block the camera , fingers are easy to block the flash , and the experience is not good It s a little bit , but my family does nt have much problem with it  allow sad  It s so interesting  laughs without a word  , I like to read your Weibo the most  laughs without a word  ? Is nt it better than the Xiaomi series ? The ip6 I bought before is still not stuck , but the battery is not good . My lover s certain apple , I forgot the generation , and it started to freeze after a little more than a year of use .  licking the screen  Is yours a family heirloom ? Redmi users , then it s okay Hahahaha , a sense of glory about the mobile phone ? X is too stuck , the signal is not good , and the heat is serious . Are you a customized version of 6p ? just brag My x wo nt get stuck , unless the frequency is very stuck when the heat is serious , but the signal and the battery life is too poor That s it . It s hot in winter and it crashes directly . I m really worried , so I changed it later . Keep bragging , my iPhone 8 is so stuck that I changed to Android , it seems that Apple is getting worse and worse . If it can achieve the texture of the 50 series , it will be good Are you sure the trash can has texture ? ? ? ? Do you know what texture is ? Not to mention the design is good or bad , the texture of the Honor 50 is really good Do you know what metaphysics is ? The big hollow in the front is quite textured Does Honor 50 have texture  Yun Bei   Yun Bei  Have you touched it?Are you sure that the texture of Xiaomi Redmi below 3000 is better ? 10s I think it s better than it  Pouting  The Honor 50 series is embarrassing to look at  spit  The decoration of the camera is like a product of the 1990s  spit  The texture of the p50 looks very nice It s not the same price , but the texture is still very different . After all , the Honor 50 and Reno6 are really selling well offline , including the 11 Youth Edition , which is also selling well , but we mi fans all found that the workmanship of the Youth Edition is not goood . High  end machine ? Sorry , I laughed , where is his high end ? His high  end is to make you laugh 6SP  Nose Digging  Have you used other models of apples ? Do you know how bad the signal of 11 is?A mobile phone even do nt have good signal , can it still be called a high  end phone ? I use Huawei There is no need to argue , the ios system is really good to use Indeed , the system does not have to say , but the signal is even more do nt have to say  Yun Bei  The signal is indeed not as strong as the Android phone , but in terms of system , performance and smoothness of use , Apple is indeed a high  end phone . The difference between Apple and Android phones can be reflected after two or three years of use . They are the best , Huawei P40 , ca nt beat Apple 8 . Debut one , it has been used for more than half a month , it is perfect  the original plan was 18 , because 888  2k4000 battery life is bad  , 12x is exactly three points are all I want , 870 , 1080P , 4000 battery Except for the price , the 12x is all good , and I am waiting for the price of the 618 to drop . As long as it is similar to the price of the 10s , I will also buy 12x . The hand feeling is invincible . After all , this mobile phone has a lot of diving space in 618  doge  This mobile phone , now in Pinduoduo you can get the top equipped for 3300  School Season  Meizu 16  doge   doge   doge   doge  Taking pictures is bad I said what he use is Meizu 16  DOGE   DOGE   Doge  4500 battery  Yun Bei   Yun Bei   Yun Bei  Ah yes , I made a typo Mr. Bu , I would like to ask which one of the realme gt neo flash version and realme gt neo2 t is recommended to buy in the current thousand yuan machine ? Also , is iqoo z5 recommended to buy  all are bought for elders  The two of Realme are the same , mine is 2 T now , which is very beautiful . The charging is fast , but the consumption is also very fast  allow sadallow sadallow sad  Okay , thank you for feedback My own experience , the battery life of 2 T is a bit poor  two ha  Okay , thank you IQOO Z5 Okay , thank you  Love you  Is the note10p screen bad ?  slap in the face  I want to exchange it for my dad The same screen quality as Huawei mate30p , you should consider it  doge  Comparing the 5,000  yuan mobile phone with the 1,000  yuan machine , your signature is correct , you are stupid A 5,000  yuan motor is on the same level as a 1,000  yuan machine , and a 5,000  yuan screen is on the same level as a 1,000  yuan machine . I do nt understand , just buy an x10 for patriotism ? Why do nt you buy a mate to pay tribute ? The screen brightness is a bit low , the others it s fine . If parents do nt use nfc infrared , you can consider q3p , the screen is brighter General  Yun Bei  Is nt this much better than the iPhone ? It is really not as good as an iPhone iPhone s before 13promax all have bad battery life , okay ? Indeed ... my 10 s battery is aging , and it can hold six hours to swipe on Weibo  cracked  Just bluetooth listening to songs , less than 6 hours to shut down , almost in flight mode in the middle  two ha  My Xiaomi Mi 11 has only 4 hours of screen time . 7p power consumption is high  Tan Shou   Tan Shou  Half of the battery is dead , ios10 is not this style Then I do nt want to update Update it . Still very smooth . The power consumption , I feel can not make a final judgment . Because I have been playing at the same time as yesterday s update , it is hard to say whether it has really become higher , or bacause playing , resulting in faster battery consumption Most importantly , are there any other problems ? Nothing else . Smooth has no problem , no freeze . It just feels like the electricity is not as durable as it used to be . I do nt know if it s because I ve been playing  Yunbei  I m already crying Now we can be sure that Huawei s workmanship must be the most precise and exquisite , , , ? Currently the most precise is Samsung Matex2 , absolutely overwhelm , go to the store to feel it without spending money , , , ?  dumbfounded  a little too confident That plastic screen is exquisite ?  haha  If you have been to junior high school , you should know that only capacitive screens are made of plastic . Secondly , I am talking about folding screen mobile phones . It does not cost money to experience the folding screens . Try it . In the end , I will not deny that Huawei s screen is too bad . My mate40pro has afterimages and green borders , the official after  sale service will change you a new screen . Unlike the brand you use , it will not be recalled even if it explodes . Major airlines are forced not to let your brand mobile phone board the plane .   poorpoor  No matter what you say , the screen of the matex2 is made of plastic . You can know it by touching it offline . Exquisiteness has nothing to do with Huawei . With the big groove in your hand , Huawei users will never understand what exquisiteness is . Also , Samsung has recalled , do nt believe the hearsay  Love you  Are you looking down on my green ? We re talking about the opposite foldable Note9pro , higher refresh rate , better photo taking , glass back cover , dual color temperature flash with NFC , note11 should only be stronger in the performance of a Dimensity 810  stability and system maintenance are not surely better than 750 G  and X  axis motor  not e9pro is the z axis  Do you use lcd screen and oled to compare the high  brush experience ? Where did the OLED of the standard version of the note11 come from , the OLED you put on it ? The entanglement and the proof did nt impress you I do nt know how is the 750 s heat Go offline to touch the charging Note9Pro to know  Doge  No , there is no note9pro in the nearby xiaomi home  allow sad  Used , poor stability Will it be so easy to burn the screen ? The S20U burned out , and now the S21U is almost too , it s already yellow , I m going to change the screen after it be smashed . . . You are under warranty . can be replaced correct It s hard for me to understand why so many people say that the screen burns . I ve used it since the s6 , and I ve always bought double . There s not a single one that burns the screen . Because you change yours too soon The s10  is not burned , and it is used for more than ten hours a day . my s9 still has nt burned the screen My s9 burned , it was burned by Baidu Navigation , very serious  tears  Retired , I m quite reluctant , feel good  doge  Coarse grain charging is better than others I said that the technical level is not the product level , so I used the word  feel  . The product is not a thing of the same period , and the technical aspect can only be speculated . mi12 is the new flagship , the technology is new , the technology of other factories is uncertain Because feeling is the weakest word . You talk about 150w for a while  there is no mass production at all  , and then you say that the technology  should  still be there , which is a subjective inference . It is really not as convincing as the charging video of the dami test , and the conclusion of that video is that Xiaomi and Vivo is stronger than oppo . So wait for mix5 , findx 5 , nex5 , and when these come out , you will know the difference immediately , mi has completely win other manufacturers in terms of single  cell , and in terms of dual  cell , green factory s low  voltage and high  current flash charging solution has a lot of advantage , mi is the fastest dual  cell now It s true just looking at the power , but it s not sure if consider the bright screen and temperature control . It s hard to say about charging now . The green factory does not produce 100 watts , it may be because they are afraid the temperature is too high to tarnish their brand . And it is also almost 150w . Under the same power , the speed of the blue factory is faster than that of the mi , but the battery is too small , however according to the news , it is also about to be upgraded . Single  cell mi should be the strongest , dual  cell is not sure yet Dami has tested the nearest mobile phone . . . Green factory temperature control and bright screen have no advantages . . . . This ca nt be argued at the moment . Not only is wireless the most powerful , but wired is also at the top , and the 67W 100W price segment is the widest . Of course , the main reason is that the green factory is too bad How many watts does the Mix4 wireless have , I forgot You can really talk nonsense , you can really smear  spit  the x series is used in every generation , where does this problem come from Come to reveal your x70pro  doge  With  on the back , be confident Be confident oppo smartphone  doge  How is the x60 signal , how is the positioning ? X60 s battery life is not good In addition to battery life , positioning and signal ? Originally bad The iPhone is just too boring to use  Yunbei  , so I bought a flip3 to play Sometimes use too much Android , still Apple , is easy to use and boring to use  allow sad  Dual wielding solves the problem  doge  Yes , an Android plus an ios is the perfect solution , but I do nt have the money to get the flagship , I can only have an ios flagship  a 2000 Android , currently dual  wielding iPhone13pro  Redmi K40 , and then there is an iPhone7 and redmi9a beside the bed as bedtime machine  doge  I changed this full screen this year , the folding screen is too expensive for me  doge  Now flip3 is not expensive , you can buy one to play  laughs without a word   laughs without a word  The price of flip3 is still too extravagant as a spare machine and a toy . I still ca nt do it because I m poor . In addition to Xiaomi and OnePlus , please recommend another a three or four thousand Android phones  glutton  The more I use it , I really like iqoo more . Which model are you using and how about the photos and videos I m using neo5 , and it s ok for taking pictures , but video is not that good . But I switched from the iqoo first generation , so the overall shooting experience is a huge upgrade for me iQOONoe5s and 9 will be released soon thanks You re welcome Oppo s hardware is bad , I recommend iqoo from Blue Factory You are good , my mate9 is really freeze all the time . . . Changed last year My old mate9 was used as a backup machine , and the speed was okay , but the memory was too small . Some time ago , I upgraded Hongmeng , which is very good . I take it out and have a look . Why ca nt mine be upgraded ? It s just 9.1.0231 , but it said it s the latest version I applied for the closed beta , and it is estimated that the public beta will be released soon . It s been five years , I have nt changed the battery , and now it s charging , standby , and the signal is all great Mate9 can upgrade Hongmeng , right ? I took a look , mine ca nt upgrade  Khan  It should be the first batch of closed beta that can be registered , and you can still upgrade at that time , you need to wait . Is there a saying , in fact , all Snapdragon 8 mobile phone s are like this . Anyway , there is no Android flagship that is very smooth . Anyway , looking at the evaluation of Dami , the Xiaomi Mi 12 balanced mode X2 is only 2Ghz , and the A710 is only 2.2Ghz . At this frequency , the single  core performance of the large core is slightly stronger t han that of the 855 . Mid  core and 865 performance is about the same . It s not incomprehensible that it gets sluggish in this case  laugh cry  Do nt say anything before you try it , just take a look at the evaluation and do nt take it seriously . No matter how bad the Mi 11 is said to be , my daily use is still better than the 865 Mi 10u . The 888 WeChat work software dual open will not drop a little frame , and the 865 will have obvious frame drop , If it were nt for the 10u 120w charging , I would have sold it long ago , and the Kirin 820 of Huawei nova7s e can not be used with dual  opening WeChat and dual  opening work software because it is too stuck . Any people say that the smoothness of Xiaomi 11 is not good ? Others say that it is not good , but they do not say that the fluency is not good . The power consumption of 8gen1 is obviously too high . The manufacturer locks the CPU frequency to ensure the battery life . So if many people say that the fluency of 8gen1 is not good , how can they advertise together ? Who are they advertising to ? X30 fluency is very good Maybe the simplicity of the native system is the reason for its smoothness You said that 8 mobile phones are all like this , and now you are talking about native I think it should be because the daily use of 8Gen1 scheduling is too conservative  crack  x30 seems to be much better The daily schedule of x30 is not much open . You do nt have to guess , it must be designed by OPPO designers , only OPPO designers design so ugly , such as findx3 I think X3 is very good looking , X2 users  Er Ha  I thought x2 was the beginning of OPPO s appearance , but it turned out to be the pinnacle  two ha  Hahahaha x2 is pretty good  looking , but the recognition is not high with the phone case , it wo nt work without the case Only OPPO users can comment on how OPPO is , Redmi users do nt deserve OPPO is superior to others  Puzzled  No no no , Redmi nobles are superior , after all they dare to command others Although find is ugly , the craftsmanship is stronger than this , oneplus makes me speechless Mainly this time it also copied Samsung s frame ... What kind of plagiarism ? The border is narrowed is plagiarism ? In theory , the 870 is better . I am waiting for the 870 small  screen flagship . It is said that it has a 67w and 4500mah battery , and wireless charging , which is great  doge  . There is also winter , 888 is okay , no hurry , I can wait until summer to change the machine  eat melon  My Mi 11 does nt feel bad either . I do nt play games . But now the new version of the system s battery life is not good . Plus it s almost a year , and the battery may not be able to work anymore . Now the screen time is about 5 hours a day . I am using 1080  60 , dark mode . I am not satisfied with this battery life . So I just changed to CV . How does CV battery life  DOGE  The battery life of the 778 is good . It lasted 16 hours yesterday , and the screen time was 7 and a half hours . There is still 20  left . I am satisfied with this battery life . I use it every day , I do nt play games . I think the 870 will definitely be hotter than the 778 processor . The performance of 870 is definitely stronger . But the 870 mobile phone redmi K40 , iqoo neo5 , I have been paying attention , but it does not feel very good . I still do nt like the look of the K40 . The width of the neo5 phone exceeds 75 , and the width of the civi 71 is comfortable . Is nt the 6.2  inch Mi 12 coming out ? The width is also low . The configuration is also better , but about 180 grams . 67w fast charge plus 4500mah battery . I bought the iPhone 12 last year and plan to use to iPhone 15  doge  12 fever is a bit serious , has 13 improved ? Did nt change , the heat dissipation sucks Never expect the cooling of the iphone , because he has no cooling system at all  not simple   not simple   not simple  The iPhone never does any for heat dissipation . If you want a good temperature , you can only expect that generation a to perform well  doge   laughing  I have waited until the 13th from the 1st generation se Unexpectedly ultra is wider . It s because of the curved surface , but this square one is so lovely  Love you  The face value of s22u can beat all mobile phones I think the 22  frame is made narrower , and the four sides are equally narrow , the appearance is higher Ultra has the feeling of Note series Just put the Note series into the S series What about Samsung ? What is worth mentioning about Huawei ? I am more surprised that there is no Samsung , the image , the screen all should be Samsung All of these seem to use Samsung screens  doge  Samsung  I am everywhere  DOGE  Samsung  Look at me , I m amazing , even Apple is no exception  doge  , there is no me on the surface , but I m everywhere  Yun Bei  Samsung just has a screen , camera Samsung ? Except for Samsung , there is no one have good camera Samsung has been bad at taking pictures for several years , photography is ok . Except for the screen is good , everything else is terrible Small and beautiful is gone . MX2 is the last small and beautiful  Right , the mx2 is indeed a classic of a generation , with a small dot design , ultra  narrow bezel , and excellent holding feel , but the battery can not be replaced , and the battery is not durable .  Dig nose  You use Xiaomi now There is no way , the pro6 plus lasted for only half a year , the home button failed , the performance and battery life of the pro7 were not good enough , so I bought xiaomi for excessive use . But I think 4 looks the best My 7 is the best looking  Brother station , there is no official one for the 12x phone case  allow sadDigital Chat Station Mine is the official silicone case , maybe it s not on the shelves yet Negative review , 12PRO are all transparent shells Xiaomi s silicone case is so astringent . The texture and workmanship are really good , but it is really astringent . It s hard to put it in the pocket . But anti  slip  doge   Lick the screen  Is it really so astringent ? 12x and 12 look exactly the same The good thing is that it is better than the honor v30 , you can mock the honor users about the stupid tax Not everyone pursues the ultimate price  performance ratio . Honor is also more than 3,000 yuan . Others just want an appearance and charge quickly , okay ? Do nt say they pay the stupid tax But even do nt pursue cost performance , should nt buy honor , can that screen be used ? . Have you seen it , I think LCD is good Honor V30 is good to take pictures See the other people commented on you ? That s one of the achievements of this conference , so you say is it good or not ? It s ok , 2999 extreme cost performance , Do nt talk about stupid tax , pay stupid tax too with Xiaomi Station bro , 11u and 12p , which one is worth buying  cute  Definitely 11U , it s totally beat 12pro 11u has many bugs , burns WIFI and burns the motherboard , the weight is outrageous , the feel is bad , and the price is even more expensive . In addition to the camera s image quality is a little better , which other points are better than 12p ? Xiaomi Mi 11 has many bugs ? What bug are you talking about ? The ip68 ceramic back cover completely beats the wide  angle and telephoto of the 12pro . Why is the advantage not big ? If you want to say that the weight and feel is a disadvantage , it is also an advantage for a mobile phone of more than 2,000 compared to an iPhone that is more than 10,000 . That s right , the reduce material phone is really not too heavy . In the end , the price of 11u is basically the same as that of 12pro , there is no  more expensive  . Excluding the screen , one is good except for soc , and one is not good except for soc Putting aside the facts , let s talk about things that have not improved in terms of user experience . 12p for sure , no need to ask . 11U burn the motherboard and WIFI , plus the system with a lot of bugs and the bad feel . The price is even more expensive . There is really no reason to choose 11U . What s wrong ? I wanted to buy it . The first time I saw someone scolding Huawei s processor  spit  Huawei s processor deserves to be scolded . The only thing that is not worthy of scolding is that it is the only one that can be used in China . It is worth scolding , that is , stealing the concept while the performance is not good enough , changing the performance while not improving . In terms of chips , they do not compare performance but signal . The previous generations of Kirin , which can be said to be business machines , are understandably insufficient in performance . From 980 to 990 , there is basically no progress . Starting from the 30 series , Huawei also began to get hot , and the battery life began to collapse when it exceeded 90hz . The most basic thing of a mobile phone is the network signal . If this is gone , it is also called a mobile phone . For example , a certain fruit  spit  If you want to buy it , just buy it . There are too many trolls on Weibo , so people ca nt buy it correctly . The p40 camera has a problem , and then the phone heats up badly So will the signal improve ?  doge  It uses the same Qualcomm baseband as Android , but the signal is not as good as Android magic 3 pro signal is not as good as mate 40  doge  Baron baseband is better No , Apple is not the baseband problem  laughs without speaking  Apple users do nt need signal , right ?  doge  It s not that it ca nt be used OnePlus 7 Pro , Mate 40 Pro , they are all over an era , and there was no such machine last year  single dog  Adding a mix1 and findx is the standard answer what is the findx ? The first generation of findx is really amazing The first generation of mate40pro has not lost compared with the third generation  single dog   sad   tears  If talk about the recent , I can praise the camera of vivo x60pro for half a year  like  The signal of Xiaomi is also average , and the current will be cut off . If want the signal is good , still should choose Huawei . The signal of Xiaomi Mi 11 is really good . After 10 , there is no more disconnection phenomenon . I do nt think it s that good , but it breaks every now and then Update the system and try another router Huawei number one  Like  Huawei started out as a telecommunications company , and it s not surprising that the signal is good . Well , Huawei number one  Praise  Which machine Second  hand 95 new s20   Tan Shou  The battery life of the S20  is not bad  Erha  I also have a BTS , which can last for more than three hours . Are you interested in the s22 big cup next year ?  doge  This icon should be Samsung ? My S21 Ultra is just over three hours and I do nt play games OPPOFINd x2pro about 4 hours Impossible , absolutely ca nt beat the Redmi Note 11 series , maybe even a fraction is not enough Realme workmanship is better A less known and inferior brand do nt talk about the workmanship The keys are not loose This is not the original q4 product , the 11 should be compared with the q4 series Commonly used routines , raising expectationsYunbei  I did nt expect Green Factory to like it so much After seeing the cv , I already have confidence in the appearance , let s see if I can buy 12pro this year civi does nt look good . . The hollow in the middle is too big . . . . The vivo copied on the back is not very good  looking . The appearance is still the best of Samsung .  Yunbei  A person who uses Huawei said that it has a big hole , can you not be so funny I use the tabletThe phone I use is real gt master exploration version  Huawei s appearance I have never think looks good In my mind , the appearance of the s20  is best It seems that the cv design idea continues from the 12 series The front is similar , the back must be different Copy according to vivo I think Xiaomi Mi 10Pro is also one of the most successful models and is expected to become the next generation of nail house The only thing is that the photo is a little white , the white balance is too bad I do nt know much about taking pictures , so I fool  like directly shot . Although the mobile phone I bought is good for taking pictures , I really do nt know how to use it and I do nt understand  laugh crylaugh cry  It probably means that the overall picture is a little white . The pearl white color is so bad Does nt it look good ? Is it the feeling of milky white and pink ? Too smart , if only it were white It s the same as I use iQOO5 . Why do I change my phone ? What s the difference between the smart refresh rate and my global 120 ? It does nt matter if the charging is faster , the battery life is similar , or even worse , 865 yyds , no problem fighting for 5 more years  doge  I also liked iQOO5 very much back then . I was delayed for some reasons , and then I bought the neo5  laughing  The texture of iQOO 5 is incomparable to neo5 , the flagship machine yyds  doge  The camera configuration is the same , and the ultra  wide angle does not have a micro gimbal . Video recording is not so stable . It depends on whether the nex5 has a Zeiss lens and T coating . According to Huawei , the camera capability of the mate series is always one level lower than that of the P series , the positioning is different . Is M40pp worse than P40PP ? ? ?  Popularized  That s right , in the past , mate was not as good as p for taking pictures , but only after the mate40p series has such a configuration Not worse . . . It s just that p focuses on telephoto , m focuses on photography , and the direction is different ... Then go ahead , m30 is not as good as p30 ? Not paying attention now . I remember that when the mate2030 was compared to the p2030 , it was only better , not worse . After all , they have half a year difference New sensors and technologies are all the first use on the p  series You re talking about different generations , I m talking about the same generation ... It seems that the mate40 series is Huawei s strongest camera , at least on par with the P40 series  doge  The mate40p series belongs to beyond the outline , it is impossible to do this in the past  doge  Are you talking about the Honor play which was scolded for having a bad screen , taking pictures sucks , and shaking badly ? The cheapest 970 , although there are many shortcomings , can be said to be very suitable at the time , this generation of play3 is too bad  two ha  No , it was not as good as the V10 at that time . At that time , I did nt pay much attention to the V series . Anyway , this generation of play3 was too bad and became a low  end machine of the Play series . So have you used it ? These are the evaluations of others , but I have used and touched the Honor thousand yuan machine before 9x pro and play . Only one processor has a good reputation .  whee  The 970 is not very good , it is similar to the 835 , and the 980 is a really leap forward . Do nt say that the feel is really good all day long , if you have nothing to do , optimize the system  Are old OnePlus users abandoned directly ? The system is too stuck , it s useless to feel good The 9r camera has been stuck since its release , and the recorded videos are all stuck  School SeasonSchool SeasonSchool Season  Mine too , and the camera photos are loading too slowly , Sure enough , it s not one case . What else can you expect from a company that ca nt do a basic function like a camera ? There are no disadvantages except killing background es , the special card , and the backstage ca nt be kept Forget Xiaomi , the more polished the worse  allow sadness   allow sadness   allow sadness   allow sadness  Yes , in terms of imagery , the grain factory data has never lost , and the experience has never won  doge  Then you tell me who he lost to  question  That s too much . After it failed with 100 million pixels , they saw that the 766 used by others was good , so start to use the 766 . Double standard . How great  laughing   laughing   haha  Xiaomi is basically the strongest 5x , okay  Yun Bei  Xiaomi algorith m really bad The telephoto really do nt have too much problem Is nt Xiaomi s 48mp 5x good ? You will know when you use it . Now it is negative optimize , particularly bad . Not as good as Google Camera Agree . Xiaomi video is really rubbish It is outrageous to beat the 10Pro . The 10Pro except for the telephoto camera is not as good as the 10ultra , and the screen charging is not so fast , in other aspects , it is all better than the 10ultra . The 10ultra bright screen charging is not as fast as the 10Pro , the 10Pro screen is better than the 10ultra , the dual speakers are better , the feel is good , and the texture is good . I think 10Pro is yyds 10p is not good  Shooting is one grade worse than 10U  10P photography ca nt even compare to cc9p  CC9P is very bad But I think 10p is really not good for taking pictures now  tears  Compared with the p50 series , mate40 series , p40 series , 11ultra , 10ultra , 11Pro , x70Pro of the first echelon , it is definitely incomparable , but it is outstanding in the second echelon . It is not bad . Personally , the 10u screen is even slightly better than the 10pro . It does not mean that the Samsung screen must be better than the Huaxing screen . The 10u screen has 1120 nits peak brightness , 120hz high brush , diamond  like arrangement , and 10 bits of original sound . I feel that 10p ro is really not good except for dual speakers The color accuracy of the Mi 10 Pro is better than that of the Mi 11 series I am from Apple fan to Huawei fan . When I went to school in June last year , in order to use the school s 5 G network , I sold the iPhone X and replaced it with Honor . I also considered Mi ov 5 G mobile phone at first , but because of Huawei s situation at the time , I decided to choose the Honor x10  originally I want to change to p40 but financial resources are limited  . . . After using it soon , I became a fan of Huawei . It s been used for more than a year now , and it s still like a new phone . With the blessing of Hongmeng , it s really easy to use . So , only after using it will you know how good it is to use Huawei . The animations have been castrated so badly , and it have nt been so smooth . Castrated ? Very smooth and fast  pick nose  There are in the forum , and there is also in bilibili My Mate 20 have been used for three years . The mobile phone hangs on my chest when I deliver food . It through rainy and windy . Harbin is about minus 30 degrees in winter and 30 degrees in summer . I work an average of 13 hours a day . I came home from get off work to play the Glory of king , 60 frames . It is no exaggeration to say that it is the same as the new one , and the battery is also very good . It can played the glory of the king for six hours with full power . I do nt know what the freeze feels like .  Hee hee  It s just that the charging is a bit poor , not as fast as the new model Mate20 is the android king of 2018 . My roommate just use the mate20 , it feels great . 2 K screen  coolcool  12p has no advantage except for a telephoto  eat melon  The 12pro with 6 G large memory , after a few years , you will know how strong it is by looking at the service life and killing the background situation . Pro is pro . In terms of taking pictures , the 13 has almost no improvement . Anyway , the 12pro has a telephoto and better texture . The bottom of the 13 is the same as the 12promax , which is larger than the 12p , and the discussion here is only about the image , what you said basically has nothing to do with the image  eat melon  And there is no sensor displacement anti  shake The main reason is that the bottom of the 12p main camera is small , and the 13 is a new processor with a stronger ISP 12pro is the stainless steel version of 12  doge  The k40 was perfect back then , and the image was terrible  The image is not bad at the same price , but the fast charging and heat dissipation are not good  K40 former user Sony 582 is not bad ? Not good at the same price It s really okay  DOGE  I think the worst thing about the k40 is that there is no dc dimming when it comes out , so I am scared to buy it . The worst thing about the k40 is the signal , which is always of f  Then my 10U can still use for 5 and a half years Have to change the battery . The 10u fast charge hurt the battery too much . The wear level is no less than my ip11  School Season  Fortunately , the battery is much cheaper than Apple s , 199 it may drop later . I was very distressed when I use 4 or 5 hundred to replaced the battery of xr before . Yes , my iPhone 11 officially need 500 , I just give up and wait for the Mi fan Festival 49 to change it again No problem for 3 more years . My 16  512 , the only problem at present is that the battery life is not good The 10u battery needs to be replaced once a year . I only changed it for half a year , and I feel that the battery life is not good .  School season  er . . The Mi 12pro is cheaper and takes significantly better pictures . The Mi 12pro is cheaper and takes significantly better pictures . Thinner and should feel more comfortable in the hand . At present , performance scheduling will be more appropriate . iQOO is too conservative . Also , pricing as a sub  brand is too aggressive . Xiaomi is a real brand after all . A real brand?What is a real brand in your eyes ? Sure enough , whoever gets the loser can get the world . Vivo , OPPO , Xiaomi are real brands , iQOO , realme , OnePlus , and Redmi are sub  brands . You refute this , how much prejudice do you have . Xiaomi has built  in anti  fraud monitoring , I will never buy Xiaomi because this Catch you , a fraudster  doge  Much better than Xiaomi , iQOO 9Pro is really strong this time It is so bad that it is sold for the same price as 12p . . remarkably brave The screen h as something good The 12P screen is also not bad . I do nt mean it s bad , but the 1  10p screen is good Compared with the 12Pro , there are no symmetrical dual speakers , no infrared , and no 120 charging . But the OnePlus 10Pro has a telephoto , which is not bad Touted  This battery life , it is better not have ltpo  eat melon  This may be a matter of luck , mine is Xm , with China Unicom card . There is no bad signal , or operator greeting  laughs cry  Mine is also xm and China Unicom , I still wonder why the signal is so bad , what s going on ? I do nt know , it s still good after I go back to the countryside  laugh cry  There is also one grid signal I will see if the signal is good after changing the mobile phone , and I will know if it is a problem of xmax  allow sad  You install 2 cards and use the data network to play the honor of king and see No , I think it s a matter of probability . My girlfriend uses Xm like me . Sometimes her signal is only 1 bar in the same place , and mine has 3 bars ... Both are Unicom cards . How could it be a probability problem , you did nt go to a place where the signal is not good The same , mine is xsm Unicom card , the signal has not dropped below 3 bars , watching movies , watching live games , playing games , etc . have no problems at all , I do nt know what is the reason for those who say that there is a problem with the signal  Erha  I think it s a matter of probability . My girlfriend has the same Xm as me . Sometimes her signal is only 1 bar in the same place , and I m 3 bars ... Both are China Unicom cards . That must be the Xiaomi Mi 11Pro of 3099 , invincible  Indeed , it is the most powerful cmos at this price . After all , it is GN2 . There is no better than this this year . Which phone Xiaomi 11p and 11U Burning wifi and motherboard is invincible This is really no way , if I m not afraid of burning wifi , I ll buy 11u 11u is used as a backup machine , and it is comfortable to play games with two WiFi connections . The main machine is Meizu 18pro . Where has it ? Pinxixi Julong , I want a cost  effective mobile phone with a better screen quality , any recommendations ? Honor 60p , wait until the 618 price cut  doge  Indeed , I will wait for this fall on debut  doge  Baby , it s already fall on debut , buy it offline , it s at least 300 cheaper . A few days ago , the local channel dealer placed an order for the standard version of 8  256 at 2600 . In December , it will cost 2800 to get it . Then SAMSUNG  Start Season   Starting Season  The Samsung system is really ,  will shook his head after using it  doge  Is MIUI not stuck anymore ?  Allow sad  You did nt say the price , mid  range GT Master Discovery Edition ? subjective  breeze  Thank you Julong    Just the mid  range is ok     beg for mercy  I helped my aunt to choose the Master Explorer Edition . Advantages , appearance , technology , screen , camera , 870 . Disadvantages , She said that the power consumption is a bit fast , and she is a middle  aged person who does nt play games . If you want to play games , think more about it . This frame , love it , this Snapdragon , bye  bye What advantage does Samsung have now ? , In addition to charging and battery life , look for other problems  love you  I only know that the camera of the previous generation product is weak compared to the mainstream of the domestic flagship . This is recognized . And the battery is nt durable either . Besides a screen , what else ? The only advantage Samsung has right now is the price advantage . Dog Mi user There are too many routine operations in this kind of experience store . Now you log in to the machine you used to log in to , and I will trust you . I do nt want to pay stupid tax , because I m not stupid , I m also a smart person , I m still more inflection point 50 Do you live on Weibo ? As long as there are digital bloggers posting on Weibo , you will mention Xiaomi . I am very curious about what kind of experience the Xiaomi mobile phone brings to you , that makes you like this  laughs cry  Give money  doge  Although I want to buy zflip3 , but after watching this press conference , the camera , battery and many aspects are indeed better than Samsung , do nt argue with me , I also use Samsung  allow sad  It s almost 2022 , and 4 G phones are outrageous What can they do ? Samsung and Apple are sanctioned by the United States . They do nt have 5G. If you like others part , buy it . If you like 5 G , then do nt buy it . If there is no 5 G , the price is cheaper and we can still be friends The battery life of Huawei has always been better than that of Samsung . As for the camera , you do nt think Samsung s 1200w is worse than Huawei s ? It s not a pixel problem . Well , Samsung really ca nt beat Huawei s camera . It s normal , after all , Huawei is much more expensive  allow sad  My S21 Ultra does not stick to fingerprints , the texture is very good , but it is too thick and heavy , I am not interested in picking it up ... You are even interested in picking up the iphone 13 promax every day . You think this is too heavy ? He has always used the Pro mainly , and he really ca nt accept the large and heavy weight of the Pro Max . The pro is also 205 g  I do nt remember exactly two hundred and what  . . This generation of s22 I do nt know , but note20u is only 208 g , what is the difference ?  doge  Compared with your iPhone13ProMax1 TB sierra blue , which one is heavier What he uses is iPhone 13 Pro , right ? I still feel light , the fold 3 s weight is more suitable Holding oneplus 8 T said the processor is OK What does  the processor is ok  mean ?  Puzzled  It s enough to use , at least the glory of the king is no problem to play yes , that s for sure , 865 yds  DOGE  Power consumption is fast  Yun Sad  Power consumption , playing games sometimes , the screen time is about 6 hours 8 T is virtual  doge  What ? Apple s crazy sharpening to excessive  allow sad  Now I shoot normally . . Blurred like a built  in filter  tears   tears   tears  Is nt Samsung taking pictures very good all the time ?  Yunbei  I have never used a Samsung mobile phone  Yun Bei  It s true that sharpening is crazy this year . I usually shoot ProRAW directly when taking important photos . For most ordinary users , they do nt use ProRaw , and they do nt know how to use ProRaw . It s still the mainstream to take pictures casually . The iPhone s photo quality orientation should change . Oppox2p and Xiaomi Mi 10 Extreme Edition , which one is better ? Feishui after using , the x2p experience is better How to say ? The screen is really incomparable than the Xiaomi Mi 10 Extreme Edition . The feel X2P is better , lighter , the screen X2P is better , 10U charging is faster , has wireless charging , and better photos Both are in use , and the x2p is better than the 10 Extreme except for charging , battery life , and taking pictures . It s even better with night view . 2020 every s product is great , except the blue factory is a little bad  doge  Picture comment The smoothness and animation of the Samsung system are really not very good . Fortunately , the system is stable , with few bugs and advertisements , and full functions . The openings and creases of the folding screen are indeed not dominant . The texture and workmanship of the waterproof screen do nt need to talk , and there are still shortcomings that need to be filled . But oneui4 animation is no problem  Erha  Without fold 3 , the S21 has been upgraded to 4.0 , which is an improvement than before , but the frame still drops . It s really not smooth . Maybe with the bigger RAM will be better . Some people think that the Samsung system is garbage , but some people think that the Huawei system is garbage . It depends on what do you like to use ? If you do nt like to use Apple , you can also say that Apple s system is garbage  two ha   Erha  Even Apple s heat dissipation is better than Samsung s , it can be seen that the S21 series has no heat dissipation at all Complimenting Apple s heat dissipation ? forget it  two ha  It s a pity that the internal screen does not support a stylus  smile  They ca nt do it , and he ca nt handle dual  screen emr communication  smile  So I think it must be Samsung  Smile  Buy the z5 , the battery is big , and cheap , and has the lcd screen The vivo system is in vain , very poor The small window is not easy to use , the others still can be used Now some older people just do nt recognize IQOO  Khan  Redmi Note10 Pro is better The screen of Redmi Note10pro is really bad  thinking  What Z5 It s 2022 , are you still sell 2020 products ?  Allow sad  In a few days , it will be 2023 . A mobile phone is sold for 3 years , which is amazing  dogedoge  I was so scared that I hurried to check the calendar  doge  Above 888 are all screwed up , 870 is only one chip , other configurations are not very good , many flagships of 865 are equipped with flagship configuration I think it s okay , maybe I do nt play games , I do nt feel the phone is hot , I like Meizu s small window mode , the system does a good job in this aspect , my 16SP is not stuck when I use it now 16sp works perfectly now , I would nt want to change my phone if it was nt for it cracked I m still using 16SP , it s still smooth and not stuck , the appearance looks okay , but the battery life is obviously weaker Bad ? In addition to the signal , which part is worse than Huawei , I want to switch back to Apple again . Taking pictures , videos , systems , and processors are all really powerful Signal , heat dissipation , charging , high brushing , file management , return button ... The 13 has a high refresh rate . I can only say that today s mobile phones have their own advantages and disadvantages . It does nt have fast charge is for protect the battery . The 13 is also the place time longest mobile phone on the market . To put it bluntly , Apple seems to have the average parameters . But the actual experience is much better than the domestic machine . I just feel that the signal is better when I use the mate40pro , and there are still some places where there is no signal . The Kirin 9000 is not bad , but the optimization of the system and photography is still not in place . I have used Apple and Huawei , and your so  called better experience is not true . Bad experience in my hands  I am using nova8 now , which is better than Apple  You apple fans can really bear it , you can really cheat yourselves . A bunch of my friends use 12 , I use m40p more comfortable than them . That phone gets too hot . Is nt the 13 that just came out have all the problems , the gap of the phone can jammed with paper , the screen is green , the screen is flickering , the WeChat is stuck , the battery is not fully charged , and the battery life sucks . I already wanted to give it back after reading Chaohua . These people are still blaming their bad luck . It s the most outrageous . No one scolds Apple . Double standard . I ve used them all , each has its own merits . Without the fingerprint on the screen , many scenes are uncomfortable , such as payment . Mobile phones prefer Android , tablets only ipadpro After the bottom layer of the camera was rewritten , the 10P camera was start much faster  Come on boss Quan  There are still people on the Internet who have raised some problems with MIUI13 , please solve it as soon as possible Really ? Is my Mi 10 saved ?  Allow sad  Using Xiaomi Mi 10 , close beta 13 , much faster than before Is the system all fast , or is it just the camera ? Really ? I just recorded half a minute of 1080p video with the 11ultra and it said it was too hot and need me to lowered the resolution  Erha  Your problem is a bug , it has already been mentioned in the internal test I have been using the development version , I do nt feel it  laughs cry  But other aspects of castration are serious , except for taking pictures is fine This buddy can use the x9 up to now , there is nothing wrong with the x60 , not everyone has so many needs But since you can have a better experience , of course you should choose a better one . Neo5 , there are not many short boards . Why do you have to choose one have more short boards for a similar price ? The screen ca nt compare to x60 Although castrated , the price is cheap , flagship workmanship , not playing games is enough  doge  Then you have to buy the PRO version His budget is 2000 , and he ca nt get a PRO  DOGE  Now tangled between 13P and 13  allow sad  Holding the 13Pro feels a little heavier , and the drop feels very strong . How is the battery life ? It s okay , much better than the XS . However , the signal improvement is not very obvious  allow sadness   allow sadness  There is still no signal in the company s bathroom , the previous Android backup machine has a signal there . In addition , I do nt know if it is a low frequency dimming problem . I feel that it is easier to make eyes dry than the XS . 13p , has everything you want , the best choice for Apple nail house After buying 13P , there are only hundreds yuan left . It is recommended not to consume in advance  doge  That must be 13Pro  doge  Although my 13Pro has already bites the dust  doge  I replaced you with two stainless steel basins , and the X in my hand could nt hold on anymore . Xiaomi mix4 OPPO find x3pro , think about it , recommend the latter Where are the advantages of OPPO s thhat one ? I think there is also find3 Selfie looks good  DOGE  I do nt particularly like taking selfies , I just play the Glory of Kings , binge  watching , and use normally , nothing else . I saw some people say that the mix4 is not good and so on . The front is not good , it is heavy , and the rear camera is also protrude . I want to ask how the magic3 is ? It is indeed heavy , because it is a ceramic body , and the ceramic feels excellent . But the mix4 is too heavy  Yunbei  Although I do nt care much to the front camera , it is still unacceptable that it is a bit blurry . And the speed of his price reduction is too scary  laugh cry  Then you are wrong . I have been using the super cup for three years . This year , I dare not buy the 13max , I bought 13pro . When the machine reaches more than 220 grams , a few more grams are super obvious , let alone more than a dozen grams , the little finger is deformed Are nt you afraid that the battery life of the 13 Pro will be bad ?  Allow sad  After reading a few reviews , the battery life of the iphone is ok this year , the max is the best , the 13 is close behind , and even the mini s battery life exceeds last year s 12 . The 13pro is not worse than the mini , right ? Wait for the battery life ranking , but the 203 grams of the 13 Pro is really ok ?  Allow sad  I ve been using max all the time , but I really do nt want to use it this year , so I bought a pro  allow sad  I still like the big screen , but the machine is too heavy . When will Apple replace stainless steel for a lighter material , I still like the big screen I changed to 13 , it s too heavy This year s battery life of 13 is also really good , better than last year s max OnePlus 9RT And this Realme GT Master Explorer Edition , in the Xiaobai database , the frame rate of Yuanshen is also good . At 53 frame rate , it s very high . And Realme GT Master Explorer Edition also have good battery life , looks and feels , but the processor is not very good , but the frame rate of the 870 Yuanshen is so high , so strange , why is this ? Blogger , I am so hesitant , please help me , thank you  Realme battery life is not good , taking pictures is good , the processor is also okay , you can buy it , but OnePlus 9rt is optimized for Genshin Impact , so the effect will be better Okay , thank you blogger Why is 1 plus 9pro not recommended ? I feel this is good , I am curious , can the blogger tell me , thanks No , no , I m stupid , okay , okay , thank you blogger  heart   heart   heart  Huawei s battery is lower than the 18s  high resolution and refresh rate , so how can it have such a poor battery life ? The screen is bigger , the refresh rate is more aggressive , some phones have a high refresh rate , but not all applications are so high You ca nt compare it , why are you making so many excuses ? Huawei ca nt compare with other manufacturers with Qualcomm . There is no need to brag . I use 18s for myself , with 2K120 the battery life does not collapse at all . At present , I only found that Bilibili Lock 60 . You are right Because of the 888 used , Huawei said that what I used before was the flagship chip of the Kirin 9 series . Now let me use the Qualcomm 888 . Can it work ? It ca nt be used . The battery life is lost to Xiaomi and Apple mini . Now no one can lose any more 18s is also 888p , what does it have to do with the processor . Negative optimization , otherwise how to sell 12 Look what you said , intentional negative optimization will not play a good role , speed up the replacement ? Consumers may not necessarily buy this brand next time , so the logic is wrong Because all manufacturers will negatively optimize  tears  They are not afraid that you will not choose the previous one Haha , this may not true . My ace has been used for more than two years , and it is still very smooth , almost not much worse than when I first bought it . Even when I just bought it , it is not so stable , two major version upgrades are good , there is no negative optimization , my colleague s Apple , Huawei are also good after many upgrades , manufacturers deliberately negative optimization will only damage their own brand .  Yunbei  10U is no longer on sale , but this high refresh rate strategy is outrageous Bro , 12  256 transparent 10u , xianyu , for personal use , the condition is relatively new , 2600 , is it worth 2600  doge  , 1600 is okay He does nt sell , but he wants you to change Pull out the nail house Realme 2k does the same thing as a thousand yuan phone . . . How can it win You can choose a phone from Redmi that is better than my phone in every way . It s not that I did nt buy the realme . . . Why so angry , my experience is this for me Is there any one can compare with master explore version at the same price ? It sounds like k40 is very high  end  That s not , k40 is mediocre , but the actual experience is better After k30 , I will never buy the Mi series again . It s too cheating  tears  Laugh to death , does the Snapdragon 888 give you 1299 ? Go to experience first Fast power consumption in standby ah ? Poor battery life ? To be honest , my Mi 12 is on standby , from 800 am to 1200 noon , the power is off 1 , and the messages are returned every sometimes  doge  , it turns out that this is called poor battery life  doge  You suck , my battery has increased from 50 to 100 after 8 hours of standby Hahahaha , then my battery life is really bad  doge  Xiaomi Mi 12 is very bad here  allow sad  I do nt know what s going on with 12ultra , if it is a curved screen , I will give up decisively  doge  Definitely still the curved surface Hope not My 12Pro was powered down by 1  overnight  about 9 hours  , which is normal . Do you believe it yourself  Call  You did nt buy it Hold s10 and wait for 23 For the time being , I also feel that the S22 series has nothing to attract me , but I am afraid that there is still nothing new in the S23  allow sad  tangled If change machine at double  digit generation , strictly speaking , 23 is the double  digit generation  doge  Yes  Yun Bei  So I really tangled The s10 has been a little stuck , mine is It happens . Electronic products are consumables , what kind of mobile phone can not be stuck all the time ? The battery life of the Mate40Pro is already one of the best in the Android camp , but the battery life of the 13Pro has already won . The mate40pro is in the Android camp , even if it is only 90hz , without 2k , the overall is still average , the overall better should be the 1080p blind eyes screen 90hz , 4500 battery Meizu in my hand . Other Android prices are all 2k I remember Huawei s battery life is very good . . . Anyway , the battery life is 13 better  allow sad  The best battery life is Mate30Pro ... Do nt , m40p is quite bad in Android , m40p and m20p are the two generations with the worst battery life of mate , I m replying you with one in my hand  Yunbei  Why I remember that Huawei s battery life is very stable Huawei only mate30Pro battery life yyds , and it can be similar to iPhone13ProMax under WIFI  The P40Pro is worse , but with 4 G bright screen can last for more than 8 hours . The Mate 40Pro loses power very quickly , and the battery life is not as good as that of the small P30 . M40P battery life is very mediocre  Yun Bei  Apple has poor hand feel , no side return , no NFC , no small window split screen , slow charging , poor signal , it is really not easy to use in work and life for me . The mini is quite comfortable to use in life , but unfortunately the battery life is terrible . I dual  wield Apple and Android , both use China Unicom , the signal is the same  two ha  I am in Guangzhou  Erha  and China Unicom is pretty good in most areas . I replaced China Telecom with China Unicom , and now I use both China Unicom and Telecom , but at the same location and the same operator , comparing the two mobile phones , Apple is indeed worse  two ha  Under the condition of the same operator , it depends on the mobile phone plan . I use the same plan , and both are same bad . There is side return , bad signal is true  sad  Only the left side , what to do if the right hand is used  two ha   Yun Bei  How about the K40 screen ? Thanks  k40 12  256 is now Jingdong 2199 , it s great  laughing  No , I bought it 1994 yesterday , I wanted to wait for k50 , but the price is too good The top match was already 1699 a month ago , bro It s less than 2000 yuan , the screen is definitely the best within 2000 , the opening is also small , but 33 watts ca nt keep up with the trend , the z  axis motor is a bit uncomfortable K40 is an X  axis linear motor Bad , hard screen , poor look and feel , much worse than flexible screen Thank you , almost placed an order Holding Mi 10pro and want to change to Mi 12X  doge  Holding 10Pro 12  512 Pearl White , I want to change to Xiaomi Mi 12 , but there is nt 512 G Yours is the top match , there is no need to change it , it is not cost  effective , the Mi 12 is very hot The mobile phone of more than 200 grams feels a little heavy after using it for a long time . I touched the feel of the Xiaomi Mi 12 in the store and I fell in love with it . Screen , loudspeaker , and even performance , are all backwards  doge  I do nt think so , 10pro is Samsung e3 90hz , 12x is Huaxing 120hz , it s almost the s a me , they are symmetrical , the performance is the same core  doge  , maybe the heat dissipation is not as good , but it feels good . It depends on the yourself , I have relatively high requirements for the viewing angle and transparency of the screen  Erha  , that Huaxing screen ca nt compare in these two points , the small body leads to a poor performance release , but the hand feel is really good It hurts to have no wireless charging , it is okay to let it be a spare when the price comes down It does nt hurt to ask . Which part is better than Xiaomi 12Pr o If it does nt like 12porn , it s good  doge  8g1 are all equally bad , no difference moto did nt downgrade the resolution . Why not buy a 12pro ? Various parameters are better than oneplus Which parameters are better ?  Doge   doge  I m playing the role of black bro At least there is a triple ois midium focus  laugh cry  I feel that the 3.3x telephoto of 800w is not as good as the 2x portrait of jn1 I compared the 8Pro s s5k3 m 5 telephoto to the Xiaomi 12pro s jn1 , both are 3X. The inherent advantage of the 8Pro is indeed clearer and the color is better . Can it be more ugly ... You think this is ugly ? You say a good  looking phone , I ll take a look  Yunbei  Which of the previous generations does nt look better than this ? The appearance of the previous generations of the s series is really beautiful Is nt this much better than Apple s unchanging appearance ? Better than getting uglier Before the Mi 3 and the two K900s were all right  angled sides , so ugly that I could nt see them . My colleague bought the Mi 3 hurt hand . Where is the 12Pro worse than the 11Pro ? The 11pro top is only 3700 , why do you compare the 12pro to the 11pro , in terms of price , it should be a comparison between 12 and 11pro , okay ? 12pro except for charging and wide  angle can beat 11pro , others like the main camera , battery , ip68 are all castrated , and now 11pro is so much cheaper , if I had nt burned the motherboard of 11pro , I would nt have bought 12pro Yes , if only look at the price , 11pro beat 12 The main camera has become worse , the bottom has become smaller , and the amount of light entering is also smaller . Without a periscope , the periscope is expensive . There is no IP68 . The battery got smaller . Really negative upgrade . Better to buy 11pro than 12pro The main camera really depends on users ... My classmates disliked his 11p starting camera slowly and shooting slowly , so he think the experience was not good  Rabbit  12pro is not necessarily bad , but 12 and 11pro are about the same price . I said this . The propaganda of k40 is also very good , and the final it screw up also fast , Mr. Lu , do nt be embarrassed at that time The sales volume of the 40 standard version and the game version is not bad  laughs without speaking  12 plus 256 , now 1849 is perfect . The game version 12 plus 128 , it dropped to more than 1900 in May last year . I bought a game version  doge  , and I was not satisfied with the camera , so I sold it , but the charging and battery life are very good  doge  1649 Sell so well K40 did not screwed up , K40Pro did 13mini is really firm In contrast , 12mini is so bad  allow sad  After almost 4 months  use , the battery capacity is still 100 It seems that Apple has given up on the 12mini . The battery life is still 13 better  Like  Are you a 13mini owner ? Yes How about the actual battery life ? How about the bright screen time ? I wanted to buy it myself , but I did nt . The battery life of the 13mini is ok , I use it for myself , it is no problem to use it for a day 13promax battery life is invincible , tested myself Newly bought mobile phones are all like this ... Use it for half a year and a year , it will get worse This happens  There is loss  All phones are the same Yup  So whether it is iPhone13pro or 12p 11p  The battery life is the same when it just bought  I never thought how good Apple s battery life is  Now it s very comfortable to charge once a day  doge  it ca nt be used up I play several games a day , and still can use it when I go home at night . It s may not after a while 13mini  not simple  The perfect choice of the multi  device people , I have an ipad for playing games and watching videos , and I only need a mobile phone with good camera , good battery life and good screen  very happy  I bought 13 because I needed dual cards  allow sad  iQOO7  13 The problem is that the iPhone s dual  card experience is too bad  two ha  It s better to put the call forwarding on the Android machine  two ha  Handheld 13mini , it is very easy to use when not playing games , and I have an Android machine for playing games Yes Indeed , but now most people have only one main device Yes , mine is to perform their own duties . I do nt like to go out with a big mobile phone , and entertainment is all at home , so I have different needs and does not conflict . 12 users said that the battery life is better than 15.3 , that is , after upgrading with iTunes yesterday , there was a current blurred screen bug  doge  13pm users said that battery life is not as good as 15.3 The battery life of the 15.3 is really good , but the 15.3 disconnection problem is serious . I hope that the official version in March , its battery life can return to the peak  laugh cry  Will the iTunes upgrade be backed up to the computer , and then it is equivalent to clearing the phone and then restoring it ?  Allow sad  I downloaded the firmware in ibeta first , and then pressed shiftupdate in iTunes , so no backup is required WeChat interface is often freeze and ca nt move You said that the 13pro has strong performance , there is no problem , but the battery life is really bad 13pro beat this year s Android 4500 5000 is not a problem If you are happy , it is not a problem to beat 10000 It is not expensive to buy a mobile phone  Haha  It s not a problem for the 13pro to beat some 4600 Androids , but it s just weaker than the MAX  allow sad  I changed from oneplus 8p to 13p , the battery life is basically the same , two charges a day I have also used 8p , and the difference from 13p is so big  doge  How do you use it ?  Allow sad  Have you never played Oujia series of mobile phone , 4000mAh ca nt win 13Pro  tears  Bros , how to choose between redmi k40 and iqoo neo5 ? Ignore the fast charge . Just play the Honor of Kings two round a day , and do nt play other games . iqoo neo5 , redmi K40 and realme gt neo2 , this three how to choose . The configuration can be seen , but which one is better to use , and which one has less problems . my question  yoon sad  Buying a k40 and using it for three years is absolutely fine K40 texture is better  digging nose  The white color is really good , the fly in the ointment is that the bright middle frame is a bit uncomfortable , and it is perfect if it is a little frosted . Must be NEO5 Hippo , how about the video shooting  tears  Answer me , if it s OK I will replace the apple I will talk about the video shooting experience in the next few days . If you know the video capabilities of the onePlus 9 Pro , you will know that it is almost the strongest in Android . Such as it supports 4 K 120  frame recording , such as support for DOL  HDR , such as it backlight performance . The OnePlus 10 Pro is only can be better . How dare you say this  Laughing Cry  Why not dare?You can try it  If you want to record video , honestly buy Apple ... OnePlus iPhone dual  wielding pass by , oh oh One plus video recording is not good . Let me tell you , 4k video is limited to 5 minutes , and it s useless no matter how much you flatter , 8Pro and 9Pro are all limited to 5 minutes , and it did nt change . Sony also makes mobile phones  dogedogedoge  I also bought Xiaomi 11U . I bought it at the original price when it first launch , but it dropped more than 1,500 yuan soon . The mobile phone is also not easy to use , I will never buy Xiaomi again in the future  Xiaomi s mobile phone has to be bought on Double 11 . It s cheap . The 10p I bought last year was very cheap . I originally planned to replace it with another Xiaomi on Double 11 this year . But the bug miui persuade me to quit . My whole family is Huawei . I have used the mate10 for more than three years and still have no problem , but the memory is a little small . I want to buy a transitional one for this year s at Double Eleven to wait for the mate50 next year . Although Xiaomi has reduced the price so much , I really dare not buy it when I see the comments  doge  Go and see the hw club , there are a lot who burn the motherboard Always overheat , With the cooling back clip , the frame still drops . Playing the sausage party is not as smooth as the s10 5 g that was eliminated before ,  Allow sad  , It is 1,700DOGE  Meizu 18 small screen , or Samsung s 2k screen Meizu this one is actually good The screen of 12 is not very good , barely okay , choose one of 60hz and dc Does your iphone have DC dimming ?  eat melon  The battery life is too bad Lose something , then can take something Xiaomi never dares to design a mobile phone below 4200mAh , I put my words here Make the screen smaller , the refresh rate is changed to 90Hz , and equipped with a Snapdragon 7 , and the 4200 battery is totally okay . So you like the Mi 10 Youth Edition , right ?  doge  10 Youth Edition screen is not small With a 778 , it will dare , and the battery life will beat 11u  doge  Xiaomi is not as cost  effective as red rice , 778 is difficult to make Mi fan pay for  dirty  778 Xiaomi only sells for just over 2,000 , and there are still a lot of people who buy it , and offline people do nt care about the configuration , just care about whether it looks good or not . Does Xiaomi s stacking ability have to worry about these ? Damn , I really want to give up Xiaomi and replace it with iQOO9 , a big soap , what should I do ? I returned the Xiaomi Mi 12Pro directly after a few hours , and it did nt work at all Bro , what s the matter ? Xiaomi game mode , night view , system response , network switching , charging , all ca nt compare to iQOO , except for the screen and feel better , the other is not good  doge  See what appearance you like , what system , what fan you are Since Xiaomi 2S , I have used no less than 10 Xiaomi mobile phones , I have also used vivo , and I have used Apple . After going around , I have returned to Xiaomi . The blue factory really ca nt be complained about taking pictures , but the speakers are not as good as Xiaomi s Because iqoo got the essence of the blue factory as a biological son  too happy   allow sad  That s right If you are using 11 or former xs or x , you can consider changing it . If it is 12 pm , there is no need to change to 13pm . Except for a high frame rate , there is really no difference . Changed from 12 pm , it s completely different  Smooth and lasting Bro , you got it so quickly , it s brutal Just okay So rich . You ca nt take money away if you do nt spend out It also added a 700mAh battery , why did nt you say Plastic is good , I m tired of glass , thick , heavy and slippery Plastic is cheap It is true , but Samsung s plastic , if you do nt see it close enough , it is basically impossible to be found . But the material has already determined the cheap stereotype , just like Apple s previous starter version 5C , which is destined to be irrelevant to the high  end . To give an exaggerated example , the impression of a mobile phone made of gold will not be cheap . There is no way , the impression of the material has already been finalized . When I bought the s21 then soon wore the case , anyway , it feels light and thin  doge  And when I sweat in summer , the glass back cover is greasy and stained with fingerprints . The plastic back cover of the s21 feels very comfortable . Why is there a lot of scolding on Weibo ? I went to Xiaomi Home to experience it . No matter 12 or 12pro , it feels really good . It is a bit high than the 11 price Full blood 12 , the configuration is so high , 3699 is still expensive ? In addition to the processor , is nt all other hardware shrinking ?  question  Is it 12 more worth it ? Have a periscope telephoto No periscope lens , periscope lens is square Who scold ? The same screen is used  laugh cry  Realme wins in charging , Redmi wins in appearance , how to choose  doge   doge   doge   doge  If you give me for free , then I want both ? Maybe I think the face value is also realme betterdogedogedogedoge  Depends on you  Doge  The face value is also the realme win , I do nt like the design of redmi  not simple  Even the motherboard WIFI was burned out , who else but Mi Search for Meizu 18 series burning WIFI ? But which one is more serious than Xiaomi The last sentence  Who else besides XX  , then I gave evidence and then  Who else is more serious than XX  , I just want to explain a fact to you , there is no need to be so mean to me . Thanks  I also want to burn it , then I can replace it with a new one , or can get a refund , teach me  tears   tears  This is almost all the problem of Fire Dragon 888 . Secondly , Xiaomi Mi 11 has a problem with the welding process . After all , Xiaomi s quality control problem still exists . Although some Xiaomi Mi 11s have the problem of burning WIFI , it is not the worst 888 Xiaomi has 5 G , has a better screen , and the price difference ca nt be used up for motherboard replacements The experience quality is too bad , who can stand a bunch of bugs in the MIUI system I do nt use Xiaomi , so I ca nt say how its system experience is , but I heard that it s only the latest version , it should be improved 10Pro is so good ? It should be said that the all the 10 series has great potential to become a nail household , especially the 10u Using the 10pro , there is no problem with using it , and the photos are not bad , but I also think about the small screen and thinness of the 12 , and I feel uncomfortable  allow sad   allow sad  There is no need to upgrade at all . Actually you just want a new phone in your heart . In fact , the 10pro is very good with telephoto , wireless charging , and dual support , not to mention 8658708888gen1 , so 8658gen1doge  After upgrading to the latest 12.5 enhanced version , it is basically the same as when it was just bought , and the battery life is almost the same . Yeah ? Why do I still have occasional frame dropsdoge  The original charger ca nt charge , and when I fingerprint unlocked , it restarted two days agodoge  Mine also have occasional frame drops , but I have never encountered other problems  hee hee  10Pro is the best Xiaomi phone I have ever used in terms of comprehensive experience Yes , next time I change the phone , I will keep the Mi 10pro as a classic collection . Trust me , buying an old Apple is the best for your needs That charging speed , battery , signal can be used ?  Yun sad  Why ca nt it be used As far as his cognitive level is concerned , do nt need Apple , Nokia is enough Signal is bad Battery ? Charge ? ? Dear Redmi users , do nt talk nonsense , okay ? At the same price , Xiaomi 16  512  865 wins in the performance , and the screen also beat Huawei . Is this not true ? There are quite a lot of small faults in Xiaomi mobile phones , but Huawei phones are relatively few  the same price as nova glory  , so we can only say that Huawei and Xiaomi have their own advantages , but the so  called buying Huawei mobile phones is stupid tax is really bullshit . If Huawei is really so unbearable , why did the United States target Huawei ? Why did the m30p sell millions in a short period of time last year ? I really hate people who smear without reason Changxiang 20 , 720P screens to cheat middle  aged and elderly people , NOVA8S E Dimensity 800 sells 2799 to cheat young people . . To borrow what that brother said . Dear NOVA users , put away your NOVA3 and quickly change to NOVA8  too happy  You do nt need to remind  smiles  The m40p is on the way . Would you like to add a friend to show you the order ? ? ? No need to show , I also have Huawei products , and I do nt use a mobile phone for 4 or 5 years like you . What wrong with Redmi users ? It s nothing , he s surly , why ca nt I ? If it is really stupid tax , with such a large sales volume , are so many Chinese people really stupid to buy Huawei ? I do nt have any prejudice against any mobile phone , but this kind of people who just speak without thinking are really disgusting  spit  I feel sorry for you . Talking to them so much is just to increase the popularity of blogger . I said that Redmi does not make user money . And he said yes ... Do nt forget to unfollow the blogger The only disadvantage of iPhone13 for me is the slow charging , but the 13 battery life is good . Moderate use for a day is no problem , just charge the battery when I go to sleep  dogeLike  Not even have the high refresh rate . The only disadvantage ? Obviously you are the one who only looks at the parameters . Apple 13 does not have a high refresh rate , but the smooth experience still beats the high refresh rate of Android 120 . You are all right  Er Ha  Is nt it bad for the battery to charge at night ? Charging optimization , it will stop automatically at 80 , and then wait a few hours before you wake up to continue . Is there this function ?  two ha  K30u said that charging in half an hour is not as fast as Apple  s. . . The battery size is not the same Battery life is not as good as 13 . Around 2500 1999 and k40 compare It s not quite like that . When I saw Qizi saying that the quality and price ratio , I thought that they might change the PPT on the spot like the last time  allow sad  It is stronger than the k40 s fast charge , but there may not as good as k40 in other places , and the brand is not good . If it is not cheap , few people will buy it , and as usual , Redmi will launch a quantity phone before the double eleven . According to common sense , it is the k40 The k40s with enhanced fast charge may be 120w fast charge Does nt this price coincide with the Master Explorer Edition ?  Allow sad  The positioning is different . Master Exploration is the main focus of photography , performance , and extreme feel , and the heat dissipation is not very good . This is like iQOO , is a gaming phone in not a gaming phone  taking photo is weaker than iQOO  Samsung s fast charging , chip tuning is indeed not as good as domestic ones , and UI optimization is not localized enough , this is a fact  but is there any domestic screen that can be compared with Samsung s ? Even with Samsung  s. And about the industrial design Huawei dares to compare ? Huawei is typically thick and heavy , and now Samsung does nt make any curved screens , Huawei is still making the waterfall screen , really easy to use or good  looking ? And you re not talking about filming ? Samsung shotting is yyds No problem , take pictures and video , only Samsung can compare with Apple in Android , Huawei takes pictures in general , video is poor With objective and fair users like you , everyone can speak freely . I ve been using Samsung for 10 years myself and I ve never glossed over Samsung s problems . Samsung s system does have a lot of small problems , Huawei s stability , the camera module of fold2 seems to be the same as that of s8 ? But I feel that I like it more than the Huawei m30p , I still only use fold2 , I have nt used the more advanced Samsung , I still like Samsung s Shooting ? YYDS?The shooting is a joke . The effect of taking pictures sucks . Every update of the S10 is to optimize the camera . Need to optimize the camera for two and a half years in a row ? S10 is still worse , you can find a better one in the same period ? Use phone more , do nt stare at the list Shooting yyds ? It can only say that it is top in Android . Excessive sharpening can make people vomit . Compared with Huawei in the same period , there are only both have advantages and disadvantages . Shooting only the iPhone is the most balanced . Three Apple users discuss Android  DOGE  I m Samsung old user Depends on whether there are water navy touting , if there are , neo5 can even beat 11u It s amazing , this is arranged already , as expected of Mi fan , good at misleadgood  Why do nt you say , neo5 beats Samsung s20u You can search for those digital bloggers , basically all of them have touted  KhanKhanKhan  Xiaobai has said that neo5 s photos are good in the show more than once Comparing the neo5 with the Redmi K40 , you can see a lot , but comparing with the Xiaomi Mi11 , it is really not comparable , the rank is different I have seen a lot of KOLs touting the 598  Khan  It s just that it is a little stronger among the code scanners , and Kol can say it is the king of camera machine . People who do nt know will think it can really beat those real flagships . KOL is fine , the water army tout more 2k , 888  , ultrasonic fingerprint . Full blood performance , this is called a small screen flagship , the others can only be called small screen mobile phones  Mi 12 small screen 1080p , 4500mah , Snapdragon 8Gen1 plus 60W fast charge , I do nt know how the photo is compared with miui13 , I feel that it is only better than 18 have a faster charge . What if it was 2k ? And 45004000 ?  doge8888 ? 888 and 8gen1 do not compare the peak performance , and the experience is almost the same bad . The 4500 battery and fast charge are indeed hard improvements . But 12 does nt seem to be 2k , it has already divulged . Then the battery life will screw up . Clearance Sale 888 battery life , you tell me which one is better , iPhone 12 battery life or iPhone 13 battery life , let s talk about it . You want a small screen , and you also want the battery life of a nuclear power plant  dogedogedoge  Just look at the parameters ? Speaking of experiencing , Meizu is more exciting  call  Who is Flyme9 afraid of ?  If nothing else , the experience of an ultrasonic fingerprint is unmatched by other mobile phones . The image is not as strong as 11u , do nt worry  laughs without speaking  I m dying of laughter , not as strong as ?  Er Ha  , that rubbish of Xiaomi , it s far from this Are you frightened by Zeiss?Laughing without saying  In addition to relying on the gn2 Xiaomi can boast , what else can it boast , the imaging is too bad , and that white balance  two ha  This is the biggest joke I have seen this year  school season  It turned out you are the Boy of the Blue Factory  Jerry  The 11U camera is not as good as the 10U , I have used both , and I finally returned the 11U I feel that 11u and x70pp are almost as good , and they will have their own strengths in different scenes . Other flagships can only be said to be the first echelon but not the top imaging system . x70pp and 11u are not the same level of mobile phones , what is the comparability ? My God , you are brainwashed do nt come to comment on me , you are directly brainwashed with a Mi 8    brainwashing ? Only people with cognitive abilities like you would have such a concept  Xiaomi can not take pictures well You have nt used any top flagship x70pp 11u , you start to quote out of context Ca nt you see so many netizens taking pictures ? ? Do you have to buy a top  of  the  line refrigerator and air conditioner from each brand in order to come to a conclusion ? 11U ? Laughed Honor 20Pro ? Laughed It is smoother and more stable than this bad machine in your hand . Are you convinced ?  cute  The Apple 6S I bought in September 2015 is still running smoothly  doge  Come on , if I did nt have a 6sp , I almost believed it Your 6sp is not good , my 6s is smooth , what does it matter ? Just weird . You can send your 6sp on to see , so that everyone can see why your 6sp is not good , is it because of your person is not good ? iPhone 8P occasionally feels stuck , 6S still not stuck  good  There is also a 6s that is really smooth . I usually use it for monitoring , and it is smoother than p40p when pulling the bar  allow sad  Come on , it can be used and smooth is not related The utilization of this folding technique . . . . Others turned the tablet into a mobile phone , increased portability , and expanded the utilization rate of the mobile phone board . Samsung turned the mobile phone into a power bank , just to increase the portability , which is actually useless . Samsung also has one that unfolds into a tablet .  Too happy  Z Fold to understand , Z flip positioning is small and portable , I suggest you still use Huawei I really do nt use Samsung . I bought this Black Shark 2 at the same time as my friend s Samsung . Both are new flagship machine at the same time . As a result , his Samsung is stuck in the glory of the king . Mine smoothness is extreme , and the same 855 cpu , Samsung s only screen is better than my Black Shark II , the rest is not as good as my Black Shark , the most important point is , the Black Shark II is not as good as the Mi 9 , and the Mi 9 is not as good as Huawei s Kirin CPU flagship machine with the same performance , poor Samsung  You can really talk . It s funny when you compare your gaming phone with others . Why do nt you compare games with a gaming laptop and a MacBook and say that MacBook is garbage ... The reality is that except for a few students who are still in school , not many people will choose the so  called game mobile phone that is stupid , ugly and heavy . Speaking of which , is there any mobile game worth buying a mobile phone to play ? But it s beautiful , and it s super easy to take . I really want to have  love you  Samsung Fold series is unfold to tablet Samsung is because of high pricing , poor heat dissipation , and poor workmanship . Come on , the poor workmanship can be seen online , smear too low  poor heat dissipation ? Except for gaming phones such as iqoo and Black Shark , I have not seen any flagship with good heat dissipation , Mi 11U is hotter than S21  high price ? Only one Soc for the whole machine ? Take 11u and s21u for comparison , the performance release of s21u ca nt even touch the butt of 11u , how can you tout ? The s21 performance release is even worse . Then there is the workmanship . After the factory moved to Vietnam , did Samsung have any workmanship at all ? The quality control was a mess , and the back cover of my s21u was even stained inside . It is said that the Samsung screen is good , but a good screen needs excellent color management to match , Samsung color management can not be called the first echelon Indeed , only after using Samsung did I know that the screen is not as good as it is said , and the software color matching is not as good as that of Oppo , and it is far worse than Apple . Poor workmanship  puzzling  , Samsung s poor workmanship  puzzling  You can smear others , saying that Samsung s workmanship is outrageous Have you never used s20 and later Samsung flagships ? After the factory moved to Vietnam , still talked about workmanship ? It s ridiculous  School Season  It turned out to be the best iPhone user in the world , I m sorry , I argued with the wrong person  tears  I m just a little brother who use san blue , ca nt compare with you Is the price of Samsung 3500 still high ? And Samsung s workmanship is much better than Xiaomi s Are you not living in China ? The starting price of Samsung s21 is 4999 , and Samsung s current workmanship is really not much better than your Xiaomi 11 Xiaomi s telephoto macro has been out for two years , and it has not been upgraded at all  laugh hahalaugh hahalaugh haha  Forget it , it s not good to use at all , it s just a little bit stronger than ordinary macro , it s not good to check the pixels  eat melon  People who look at pixels every day are neurotic . Xiaomi s that one is much better than a microscope for taking pictures . You can really fantasize . Xiaomi s telephoto macro ca nt shoot micro at all , gt2pro can really shoot micro . An excellent mobile phone should be practical for micro , telephoto , and ultra  wide  angle shooting . Xiaomi please do nt make a microscope . You can consider telephoto and macro as a slightly advanced lens to make up the number . With the effort to make a microscope , is nt it better to make a telephoto ?  eat melon   eat melon   eat melon  You think it s useless does nt mean everyone does nt need it But the pioneer , leading the telephoto macro It s just garbage . I m telling you that if you want to shoot well , you must use a stabilizer , and turn on the lights . With these , you will find that use the main camera zooms is the same . With Lei Jun s character , Xiaomi is said to have neither this nor that , and I believe that he will fight back with strength . Just like Xiaomi was told that it s charge , take pictures , sound quality , and screen is bad . Now it s doing very well in these aspects . Come on , the same 120 fast charge VIVO will be fully charged in 15 minutes , and Xiaomi half of it has not been charged yet , take a photo freeze once per five seconds , it is recommended to refer to the  Xiaomi Bible  for Harman Kardon sound quality , the Harman is gone , just the rest is stuck . And the screen ? ? Samsung s screen is not made by Xiaomi . I really do nt know what to brag . Buy other people s things and then brag yourself and sell it yourself ? You seem to have used it ? If you do nt like it , do nt come to find a sense of existence , you can directly past it , dear Xiaomi Changjiang Fund participates in the reorganization of Datang Telecom , Datang s automotive  grade chips , things need to be linked together To be honest , the 11u has fewer shortcomings and more bucket than the x70pro . The x70pro is obviously a bit of partial section , but the imaging system and screen are really good . 11u is also very good in these two aspects , but the image stabilization of 11u is definitely not as good as that of x70pro , but it should be able to beat x70pro in other aspects . About the main camera , they should have its own strengths and weaknesses . I think vivo wins in algorithm . The rest of the lens x70pp is a bit economical . In general , I think Zeiss is definitely good at improving the image . The main camera image should be stronger than 11u , but it is equal . The rest of the lenses are hard to say . This time , the x70pp focuses on portraits , which should be very strong . It is more suitable for girls to go out and take pictures . The screen should be 11u slightly better ? 2k should be better than vivo s E5 luminous material , it seems that the screen of x70pro should be the same as iqoo8pro ? I only feel that the screen has an advantage , the imaging system is not as complete as the 11 , and the charge and battery is also average The four anti  shake lenses do make itself known outside of fixed circle In my impression , the 11u only has an ultra  wide and no stabilizer , but I do nt have such high requirements for the stabilization of this lens for video recording , and the main shooter and telephoto are the most lacking . Where is partial I have been using Apple 11 for more than two years , and I am still struggling with 4 G signals . I really want to change to an Android flagship , but I feel that none of them is good so far . Should I use Apple again ? Choose the one you like , anyway , the 888 and the new 8 manufacturers are similar , otherwise you will wait for the Dimensity 9000doge  I heard that oppo find will use MediaTek Do nt change your phone for 5 G Mainly Apple 11 s signal is too poor Bought 5 g , still using 4 g P50Pro is so strong ? Is nt MOTO even more surprising ?  Doge  Why are you surprised ? Is nt this the most basic feature of the native  like system ? I heard that the 870 of moto run slowly  doge  It has always been , but the screen is too bad New Zhou Dongyu , it is not excellent  But definitely not bad  Even not as good as Xiaomi civi . Poor color and clarity Except for 4 g , p50p basically has no disadvantages , except for those who insist on the pursuit of the top screen Quit1 , I feel that Huawei charges fast , takes pictures well , smooth , accurate positioning , good signal , large battery , Meizu s system is very user  friendly , the phone is thin , and I want to use it back Oh oh , Huawei is good , and the price is very good Irony me , you know it s uncomfortable when Meizu green screen , of course you have nt experienced it You will know how uncomfortable it is when the Honor have a green screen . Of course , you have never encountered it before . Does this sound familiar ? Hey , mobile phone , bro , it is normal to have problems . Who told you that the brand of Honor never has quality problems ? I like Huawei quite a bit , stop fighting Flyme we can see that the idea is very good , but the workmanship is too rough , so I wo nt go back Quick search on the side , the bullet screen notification in the game is really good to use So you use Mate20 Everyone , how does it compare to the 10pro ? My last phone was 10pro , and the current one is 11u . I am not satisfied with this speaker , and I am struggling with the speaker performance of the 12pro . I do nt feel how much the 12pro s speakers have improved . The most uncomfortable thing is the way it is arranged . Watching videos and playing games on the horizontal screen will always block one , which is very uncomfortable . I tested it myself . 10pro is really more uncomfortable , both are covered Adjust 10Pro speaker to human voice mode , completely beat the 12Pro 10pro is the best , everything else sounds stiff The 12Pro definitely sounds better than the 10s 10Pro . You can go offline to compare My 865 Continue to serve The 10u stable version was upgraded to 12 minor versions the day before yesterday , and it feels that the battery life is OK again  allow sad  Want to change 10U , Thick and heavy  doge  The screen is not very good , that s all these little problems Mi 10 hold on for a while , and then change the battery  doge  How to check the battery health  question  To call the system log , this software is inaccurate Use 855 is so miserable 855 is actually not bad , it okay for daily use Hahaha indeed , if you play the glory of king , you have to lower the picture quality by a notch Do nt , the 18w of that year has been passed down for several years  eat melon  So now MIUI should be scolded , maybe the bug will be fixed  laughs without speaking  Recently , fans of other brands who help me to scold MIUI feel a lot less , a little panic  bitter   bitter  I hope they can tirelessly to scold MIUI day and night , so that I can use a smooth , stable system with more functions Hahaha ... awesome In the past , the ancestral taking pictures was poor  doge   eat melon  It s like it taking pictures good now , I ca nt focus when I scan a code It s not really , the k30u garbage camera ca nt take pictures well , scan the code is good , it s very fast  dogedoge  As we all know , Xiaomi changed after being scolded . This is true . I hated him for being slow in charging at the beginning , sticking to 1999 and not daring to use new technologies . As a result , all the places that were scolded at the time are changed now  dogedoge  When the K40 is charging , the back cover is very hot and the power consumption is also very serious , Miui12.5.6 battery problem or system optimization problem ? This is a new machine Also , from Xiaobai s data K40 battery life is not weak I guess it s fake . After WLAN connection , 10 minutes lose one power , it is very fast . It s not as good as my K20pro , which has been soaked in water and used for two years . Is there a problem with one power lost in ten minutes ? Is nt it normal ? It of course will drop when your screen is on Apple s 20w charging is hot , let alone 67w K40 33W Want to charge quickly , but do nt want it to heat up . It s hard to do . Fast charging , fast power consumption , how to explain this I also have these requirements , and then bought p30 , just found a second  hand  wit  6  128 , 10 sheets I am also a P30 user , and I am also waiting for a small screen mobile phone . Wait is there a Dimensity 9000 or 8000 later ? I feel that it can still fight inside P30 can still work , Hongmeng is very smooth , but 128 G is not big enough I heard that the camera is blurry after the p30 series upgraded to Hongmeng , do you have this problem ? 1000 really ? 400 million to 500 million in only 10 months , will 600 million be far away ? I do nt know how far it is , but with this kind of miui , if I buy Xiaomi next time , I m a  Like you , I have used a few Mi and am very satisfied . But this Mi 11 has been used for a week and I want to smash it , this is the last one Tell a joke . The flagship machine with more than 5,000 yuan has been used for two months . It dropped frames when playing games , killed the background and even killed the music app , songs just gone when I listen to music . There are endless bugs . Stuck interface , black screen , screen out of control , ui charging , price diving compensation to send earphones , the connection between earphones and mobile phones is all bugs , I m obviously wearing earphones , it reminds me that I am not wearing earphones , ca nt reduce noise , the mobile phone does not display the power of the earphone box , ca nt control the earphones  power situation , this is the Xiaomi s optimization of two years . Set a small goal  Laughing without saying  Set a small goal first , such as earning 100 million first .   Wang Jianlin  flowers   Xiaomi serves those things  Xiao Ai classmate Ai  Xiaomi company  dig nose  I hope this 870 model can do a good job of cooling , do nt make a copper pipe like the k40 Hardware heat dissipation is not the main problem of Xiaomi , it is enough to change the metal middle frame and add a copper plate . The main problem is MIUI . It is so bloated that if I do nt open or use many things , it will cause the mobile phone to switch pages and applications to drop frames and freeze . The continuous switching of pages under high load MIUI ca nt support it , and it will soon drop frames and freeze and the touch is not working , especially with the 888 . The 11p I sold is said to have excellent heat dissipation , but it is still the same , and the experience is not as good as the k30p . This year s 888 , I know all of these , plus the negative optimization of the system , of course not work , I also want to change to other brands , but I am used to using Xiaomi . I have been very tolerant of Xiaomi Mi 10 now . I have changed the battery , and it will not be a problem to fight for another year . MIUI is indeed very bloated , and some functions are not even usable . I also suggested deleting some functions . Seriously , do nt hesitate to change it directly . I have used Xiaomi for 6 years in a row , and I have never changed a mobile phone of another brand . I do nt know how much I have used the flagship from Xiaomi , I just watched miui getting worse and worse , I still wait and see for a while to see if MIUI can be better , and then I ll buy it again if it become good . Compared with the 10s , which one has better heat dissipation ? The 10s is better . The Mi 10 in my hand has good heat dissipation . At the K40 conference , there was no mention of heat dissipation . You can download the mobile phone performance ranking for reference . There are relatively complete parameters . I read your Weibo every day just for the news of Samsung s22u  tears   Lack of machine  allow sad  , the s21u beats the current machine , the texture is very good , the material is stacked a lot , the industrial design of the camera screen is very top , the domestic machine is really not good  allow sad   allow sad  I heard people say that the screen of Samsung S21U is not as comfortable as the screen of Xiaomi 10Pro indoors ? They also said Samsung s 100 million pixels is not as good as Xiaomi s , and the tenx optical zoom is not very good ? Xiaomi is the sky , only xiaomi is the best in the world  doge  The domestic machines are almost all garbage , mainly because the industrial design is unimaginable bad . No matter how awesome the parameters are , it will screw up as soon as you get started in your hand , and both feel and workmanship are a mess . Needless to say s21u , as long as you go to a physical store to experience even s21 or s21  , you do nt want to touch the domestic machine anymore . I agree with your opinion  like   like  Except there is no push and background management garbage , it s just perfect  two hatwo hatwo ha  The performance release of Xiaomi Mi 12 is really bad , I believe it if you say it is the Snapdragon 855 Anyway , it s not your money that you lose by burning wifi  What s wrong with being conservative ? Then do nt advertise powerful performance . This scheduling is not strong Everyone else is bragging , if Xiaomi does nt brag , would nt it be a loss ? Whether it is Master Kong or Uni  President , is nt the outer packaging of instant noodles are all beautifully painted ? You are stupid , believe in the propaganda of the merchants , and blame Xiaomi ?  pick nose  So conservative in winter , I ca nt think of it in summer Go away , my 855 could nt be that bad  dogedogedoge  Double Eleven 2000  3000 , which one is the most worth buying ?  doge  I think realme gt master explore edition Hand  held oneplus 5 user decisively change Handheld GT Master Exploration Edition Master exploration can take pictures and play games , all  round I heard that the battery life is not good  laugh cry  Let s see it after , in addition to the new phones , the old flagships will also reduce price . Huawei s mate series will cut prices  question  Redmi k50pro and findx5 who has better texture the latter Did nt you say that the K50 standard version will also be available this time , but Lu said it wo nt ... If you want to compare the texture , you need Xiaomi to compare with the oppo flagship , redmi is indeed a bit worse Lu s knife skills are too accurate  laughs without speaking  Do you still need to ask this question ? I m curious as to what OPPO phone can be used for 4 years ? Next time I will buy this series too . It is said that the Snapdragon 7 series is very stuck after a long time . My Mi 9se6  128 has been used for 2 and a half years , and it is quite good . You can buy Xiaomi  doge  In fact , everyone s needs are different . For a heavy user like me , 8 g of RAM is not enough so far , the running speed of the 870 is alright , but it wo nt last until next year  allow sad   allow sad  If I use the 870 , I should be able to use it for at least 3 years . At present , I will definitely not consider the Snapdragon 8 . The Xiaomi Mi 12X is my favorite small  screen flagship  doge  OPPO vivo s phones are really durable . I see a lot of people use it for years . I used to say it is high price and low configuration . I look down upon it , either . It turned out I found that the quality is really good . But there is no playability . Xiaomi has high playability . But not stable . Those who want to use it for a few years . I do nt bring it , I recommend using xiaomi . Vivoz27 , that lift one , one of my classmates bought it since it was released , and he still use it now  two ha  My brother is still using the vivo x6 , but the battery is not good . I saw a colleague using it and laughed at him , but he still wo nt change it unless he ca nt use it anymore . Now his mobile phone s camera ca nt work well . My mix1 has been used for more than 5 years and I am still using it . Buy Xiaomi next time  doge  Cool  doge  , my mix2 will be four years old , and I will replace it with 618 next year . I plan to change this yeardoge   Yunbei  I did nt buy a flagship machine , but I also used a few R series  r5 r9 r15x  I really think it s good , provided do nt play games . I basically use each R series for 3 years . Although this one does get stuck when I open the APP , it is still very smooth after it is opened , and the battery is relatively sufficient . About signal , basically , when my friends have no signal , I can still make calls and use data traffic . As for durability , I have dropped it many times anyway . Now it s okay to say it s a new phone That is right , very good , I have used one for 7 years and it is not bad , it is too powerful  Allow sad  My r9 can fight again if I change the battery . I hope OPPO will continue to maintain this quality and then work harder . Now I want to change to the x3 find series , it seems better That s right , the r9 was already waterproof in those days . I dropped it once into the bucket and picked it up immediately , nothing happened  laugh cry  But OPPO s new products are updated too fast , sometimes I just bought one for a few months at the beginning of the year , and then they released an new model  laughs cry   allow sad   Erha  I have never repaired it during my use of OPPO . My last r9 can still be used , but the battery is not good and the consumption is relatively fast . The r15x in my hand has no other problems except running slow a little . It has been used for 3 years .  Yunbei  So I feel like I m still a fan of OPPO . As for the photo shoot , I think it s just average . Maybe it s because I have nt uuse the flagship ?  Erha  Maybe I m not very good at taking pictures , anyway , the pictures are not good During this time , I ca nt see the 12 tests , all is pro . A little speechless , I wanted to see the test of 12 s Sony 766 , and how is the battery life , but there is no test for several days . Going to the physical store , the feel is okay , and seeing ordinary users online said that the battery life is average . It needs to be considered whether it is worth buying , after all , there are a lot of new machines in January  doge  Soon , many people have just got their mobile phones , you can wait Dami for test , his video is in the process of production Dami ? His Xiaomi machine video has no reference value ... please prove how wrong he is It seems that there is no 12 in the media machine given . I see that some test people have , but they only explain 12pro 6 and a half hours of maximum brightness Data traffic ? You use daily , or play games , or wifi . If it is 3999 , why not buy Xiaomi 11pro 3699 ? Because the 11pro is really ugly , only the photo is better than the 12 2 K large screen , wireless charging , battery should all be better than 12 But the appearance discourages a large number of people , 12 and 11pro are not the same positioning group Buy new and not buy old , and the price difference is not too much After the 12 came out , the price of the 11 series rose  glutton  It s up to you to change my mix2S or not My mix2s is replaced by Xiaomi 10s , the battery is dead The same as me , I just changed it for two day  Smile  Mine is also mix2s , just wait for k50 , if there is no small screen version , then buy 12 , unfortunately it is curved  Sweat  Mine is working as a backup , now holding 11u ? ? How much detail is lost ? ? Are Aduan s fans all Huawei anti  fans ? Little brother , the reno is really better than the Nova5 for taking pictures . The front camera is for shooting people . If you want to compare the details , you should use the rear one to compare . So what does super night selfie mean ?  eat melon  I also think R is better . Huawei is the best for shooting scenes , but the beauty algorithm is not good . If you really want to shoot scenes , use the rear camera . The front camera is to take beautiful pictures of people . What details do you need for a selfie ? ? ? ? ? ?  If you take a selfie on the Bund in Shanghai , do you think the background is important ? Why do nt need details ? As long as others know that this is the Shanghai Bund , it s fine . Is nt the focus of selfies not the face ? They just say that the second one looks good , but they did nt say that Huawei is not good . Do you understand again ?  Too happy  Pay attention to the word  most  , I want to ask you if you can take pictures ? Do nt call white black . I m thinking about the missing details and you do nt say you are   ? I ve bought so many iPhone s , how come I ve never had a problem Yes it has , fortunately , it was found early Mine is also a 13pro , I bought it on Double 11 , I got it in December , and it started to freeze in January . Sometimes I open the camera and it does nt respond , and sometimes I find that nothing is displayed when I type ... Me too  Sometimes I can only type in pinyin , but I ca nt type any words . What the hell ? You are lucky , if there are all problems , then if Apple is not closed down , that is , the users are all stupid To put it another way , Apple has indeed solved the employment problem of many people in China , so we ca nt just look at one aspect . Does this have something to do with the product has problem ? No problem , that s fine Why does everyone keep fixating on that when Apple has something wrong ? Apple is not very cost  effective . If want to campare cost  effective , Xiaomi is the most cost  effective , but Xiaomi is not durable . Apple s system is smooth and hardware is powerful , but expensive and not durable . Huawei s flagship machine is very durable and comprehensive , but it is also expensive . It s a personal choice I bought 7 in 2017 and sold more than 800 this year . Does anyone want your 2017 Xiaomi ? 6188 can buy three Xiaomi at that time , you really earn a lot It ca nt be compared like this , Xiaomi can not be used to this year , and the cost of changing mobile phones from 2017 to 2021 is about the same as buying an Apple . The use cycle is long , the second hand value preservation is high , and the overall cost performance is high . Indeed , now xs max can be sold for more than 3k How many people are willing to accept second  hand Xiaomi ? Many people are willing to accept second  hand iPhone 7 Blind guess 40  Mi 10U charging intermittently , do not solve it ? If the mobile phone is broken , go to the after  sales service for repair . It ca nt be solved here . After sale said it has no problem , you  The remaining 60  takes 25 minutes  sweat  A total of 18 minutes is full ... what nonsense ... Bingbing posted this morningdogedogedogedogedoge  Bingbing  Heart   Heart   Heart  Big soap , if I do nt play games , can I buy a k50 e  sports version ? How about taking pictures ? No  doge  You are not the target group Bro , this is embarrassing  The digital series is perfect for your requirements If you are a Mi fan , you can buy Xiaomi Mi 12 Oh , it feels a bit small Although the game is one thing , I think the most important thing is that the max battery life is too high this year . Android ca nt compare with it at all  laugh cry Some 5000mAh models with 778 processors can be compared  laugh cry  Are you sure they can compare ... Go to see Xiaobai database yourself But it s probably the biggest and heaviest phone . For the texture of stainless steel , the weight can also be understood . Agree , 13pm is an ip that gives me no battery life anxiety Good evening Pigo , will there be an LCD mobile phone with a lower positioning such as the 870 this year ? The family shed tears when watching OLED  disappointment  , thank you Pige  cheers   cheers  Personal suggestion , iqoo z5 , 778 G is enough , I think it is very smooth , and this battery life is really invincible , the only dissatisfaction now is that the camera is too bad Go to Kuan to find a Google camera to try ? Mainly because the hardware is not good , it is useless to find anything nothing now Okay , thank you Pige  Disappointed  Meizu quickly upgrade the system , there are too many bugs and often get stuck What are you using ... After I upgraded my 17Pro to the Flyme9 , except for the occasional camera freeze , there is no bug at all . 18Pro , a lot of bugs Same 18pro , I m browsing Weibo right now . What bugs are there ? I do nt encounter them at all . Is there any bug  doge  I wanted to buy it And watching Tencent video appear like this Will Meizu have a direct screen release this year ? s21 is very good , but the urge to change to 22 is too strong Just changed the back cover , no interest at all Is nt the processor changed ?  Yunbei  I am struggling to buy 21 or wait for 22 . Is the Snapdragon 888 overheating seriously ? How is the battery life ? Do nt change , if you want to change , change to 12 g , 8 g is really not enough , a WeChat is enough to make you uncomfortable Notification push does nt work It really does nt work . If you do nt stay in the background , you ca nt receive messages . 21 is good ? Gesture operation always dropped frames The motor of the k50 e  sports version and the motor of Meizu , which one has better vibration  doge  I touched it offline , the k50 e  sports version is amazing  meow  I went to see it , but I think the border is too wide  doge  Yes , and there is no texture to hold it , it seems that the K50 will be returned , and I will wait for the ultra  allow sad   two ha  Tried it offline , still Meizu is better Thank you brother  Doge  At present , the tuning of Meizu is very good , but the K50 has not been touched , so it is not easy to draw a conclusion . Thanks  DOGE  Then only the mi freeze all the time  dogedoge  Because many people use Xiaomi , so more people smear it . Die of laughter , Xiaomi Mi 10 and Xiaomi Mi 11 are stuck when switching cameras , the party said that he will never use Xiaomi again  dig nose I am also using Xiaomi Mi 10 , how can it be so serious ? There are only a few new Snapdragon 8s in total , all of them are stuck . It s just that Mi has a lot of voice on the Internet , and others have clout ? No  doge  Blue and green have no clout  cutecute  mi just started getting stuck in this generation ? Is MIUI12 called stuck ? It ca nt be used  Top  What do you mean , Realme used performance and cost  effectiveness as its selling points to stand firm in the low  end online market , but now it has to face different groups of people . For Xiaomi , although products such as civi and note11pro are not buckets , they are aimed at Offline experience and sales . When the time is right , realme will not only launch bucket machines , but will use medium and low  end products with trade  offs to help it develop offline markets and stabilize offline channels . May I ask whether it specifically refers to such as charging , taking pictures , memory , and processor are particularly strong while the other parts are relatively weak mobile phones , or stupid tax machines like Note11 ? If you think it is , then it is . Anyway , the market will speak according to the data , not according to what you say . Honor has released so many machines with low parameters that you think are low , but the battery life is long , the system is smooth , and the after  sales convenience is still applauded offline . You think you re a smart person , but you re just a little smart . Occupy the big market with cost  effectiveness first , and then explore market segments . Redmi Dimensity 920 dares to sell 2,000 I know , it s just that I remember 11pro s sky 920 is a very rubbish server . You mean to go the wrong way , is it only strong in one aspect ? Say something unpleasant , 11U is invincible , Invincible what Blind guess is that Xiaomi 11U wins all , you will be sour , and you will not admit it . So amazing  like  God , invincible at every turn ... I dare say 3.5x ca nt beat p50p . In terms of color , the p50p is more natural and more comfortable , I like it better anyway .  Puzzled  Huawei experience is much better than other Androids . The reason I do nt want to use Apple is that the system is too occluded , and then the charging speed , battery power , and signal are not good . How good is Huawei s experience ? I used to use Apple before , but I changed to Xiaomi last year . Where is Huawei better than other Androids ? The experience is varies from person to person , but no matter what everyone says , it always depends on the sales in the market . Before the sanctions , Huawei ranked first in China and second in the world . The sales of high  end machines in China once beat all of them . The illustrious record , the p50 series is so expensive , it is still very popular I do nt think the sales volume can tell whether the product itself is excellent or not . To say it unpleasantly , it is stupid tax . I do nt mean that Huawei is stupid tax , but I have nt used it , so I ca nt understand what Huawei s excellent experience is . Now I use MIUI13 , the stability is worse than IOS , but it does not affect the use . This is true , I have used Apple 11 , the signal is really not good , and the battery life is acceptable to me . This is not my experience , it is my colleagues . Every time they go to the underground garage , they have no signal , and then I have to pay for them . I used Hongmeng before . To be honest , I did nt feel very good . Entering the settings and then swiping down will always freeze and drop frames . Is it such a strange problem ? I feel that Huawei only gets stuck when the negative one screen , and it has been turned off . Anyway , I think it must be Apple or after Huawei has 5 G in the future . I heard that Hongmeng 3.0 will solve the cold boot problem , and the demonstration effect is good . There is also vivo , the system is very smooth and there is no big bug iqoo is a one  off business . the 5pro lens package will not be available until 2.0 , which has been delayed for a whole year . The camera function is not perfect . I used to urge Gelan . At the beginning , they said that 2.0 has the opportunity to update the functions of time slow door , but when it came out , they said it was too difficult to make . Really?So stingy ? In the same period , the x50pro has some camera functions , but the 5pro does not . I think the battery life of the x60 super cup is too bad . I want to change it , but vivo has no good models for a while . 5PRO workmanship is really bad Indeed , I touched the x70pro offline and it felt really good The difference between iqoo and vivo is obvious . I do nt know how this two generations are . I did nt touch iqoo9 . The iqoo5p I used have a big gap on . I bought Xiaomi Pro15 Ruilong Edition R7 on Double Eleven , the CAD is a bit stuck , I regret it  allow sad  That should be fine , how much memory does your computer have ? 16  512 , I do nt know why  Yun Bei  I only look at the electrical drawings , maybe your machinery consumes the graphics card  laughs cry  Set it up and it wo nt get stuck , it s not a computer problem Set up the computer , or set up the CAD ? I am a mechanical major , we also use cad , mine is Xiaomi pro14 , it is very smooth , check the setting method on Baidu How about watching the video That must be fine The oled screen is strong , mine is coming soon The Xiaomi Mi 10u can still fight this year , not to mention the 11p and u , the Xiaomi Mi 12u does not need to be too hurry to release . OV48C is still the strongest mobile phone static imaging  two ha  ISO FUSION in the CMOS terminal is too buggy Why Xiaomi did nt use Coway s sensor later  two ha  10 Extreme is just short of a good ultra  wide angle , and the rest is the white balance of a few cameras I sometimes feel that the pictures I shoot are very good , maybe the screen is not very good , and the pictures do nt look very good , 12u will also be released soon , mainly because the standard versions of the 12 series are not very good . You look at the sales , if there is no good attractive one in 12 series , all of them will be bad . 12 feels really good , if you do nt care about taking pictures , 12 is really good Ask which manufacturers  product ideas that can be recognized by Shui Ge ?  doge  Oneplus for diving , blue factory with reduced price One plus system maintenance is a big problem , and the flagship should be changed every year .  laugh crylaugh crylaugh cry  The current oneplus should not be good , right ? Diving s 9p top with 4000 kills every one , except for the battery life , I m waiting for 10p diving  doge  It really is a poor area  dig nose  In fact , the 870 is usually enough , as long as other configurations are not castrated  Erha  I ll wait . If the small cup configuration is not good , I might buy x3 , at least it has 2k screen . The x3 is not bad for taking pictures . I have been looking at Xianyu that second  hand findx3 256 G for less than 3,000 recently , but I want to wait for the Dimensity version of findx5 , the 12 installments ready 256 directly to Pinduoduo 3500 , may be lower after the x5 release You only look at the performance , in fact , the various peripherals of the 870 are outdated What about Dimensity 9000 ? I do nt know how Minimal baseband power consumption is much lower The weakest part of the 870 is that 5 g consumes a lot of power . I just felt it when I switched from 4 g to 865 , but the subsequent 888 and 8gen1 are very poor , this defect is not significant at all . And it is actually set off as a classic CPU . Hope Dimensity 8000 can let 870 leave The Mi 6 is at its peak , the Mi 8 is whipped , the battery life of the Mi 9 is poor , the screen of the Mi 10 is poor , and the Mi 11  if it is not 888 , it is very comprehensive  Mi 10 screen is good In the early stage is okay , but I changed it later It turns out that you are talking about Huaxing  Yunbei  Mi 11 burn wifi  Meow Meow   Meow Meow  So brackets 888 The screen of Xiaomi Mi 10 is a scam  I bought two Xiaomi Mi 10s together , one black and one red , but I did nt pay attention to the screen at first  when they advertised , they used Samsung screens as their propaganda . I think they were all Samsung screens . After I got the mobile phone , I compared the two and found that it was wrong . After inspection , I found that the black screen was a domestic screen , and the red screen was a Samsung screen . When displaying black and gray , the difference is obvious , that is rag screen . Their Samsung screen is advertised as 10Pro , and it was just released at 10 oclock and they said that the early Samsung and the later Huaxing You can adjust the parameters manually , after all , Xiaomi cameras are generally regarded as garbage  doge  During the blind test , the photo selection rate of Xiaomi mobile phone was the highest . It s a pity that as soon as the brand is exposed , it is said to be rubbish  It s really not good . The peak of Xiaomi camera adjustment is Xiaomi 8 and Xiaomi 10u . Others are either not easy to use or the algorith m is not good . paratrooper , During the blind test , the photo selection rate of Xiaomi mobile phone was the highest . It s a pity that as soon as the brand is exposed , it is said to be rubbish  ? It s not as good as my K20P  not easy  Your name is recognized ? I bought a mobile phone and I do nt think it deserves to be called high  end . I think it s not good . What s wrong ? Are you worthy ? That s what you think , do nt talk  recognizedall day long , you represent yourself 6 Xiaomi mobile phone users said  do nt buy Xiaomi if you take pictures  doge  Xiaomi is not good , why buy 6 I bought in dreams Try Xiaomi Mi 12 , the best , most realistic and most natural mobile phone I have ever used From the iPhone client Users who have used mi4 , mi9 , and K30 Supreme said that you said it very well  doge   Yun Bei  I did nt expect Apple to be able to boast battery life  dig nose  Boast battery life ? Do nt you know that the 13pm battery life beats all Androids ? ? Which digital self  media did not say that the iPhone s battery life is the top this year ? ? Do nt say nonsense , the mind is still stuck hundreds of years ago  angry   angry  Haha , what are you angry about ? Without solid data to prove it , how can you be sure ? No solid data to prove it ? I laughed so hard , a frog in the well Laugh to death , 13pro s batteery life lasts a whole day without pressure Do nt talk nonsense  Allow sad  Heavy use will only last for more than 5 hours 13pro Max battery life is really okay for a day of moderate use , from 800 am to 700 pm Is nova7 pro recommended to buy ? Why do some people say that the configuration is not as good as nova6 nova7pro , curved screen , lighter and thinner 985 integrated , nova6 thicker , 990 plug  in , if the game performance requirements are not particularly high , in fact , the nova7pro experience is better Which is better to buy , 7pro or Honor 30 Standard Edition ? Personally , I think you can consider the appearance color first . The big logo of Honor is very eye  catching . If you only consider the brand , choose nova7 , after all , it is the Huawei logo . Other performance indicators are actually similar . Hello , how to choose between 30s and nova7 ? I do nt know , but my friends recommend 30s . Nova s price  performance ratio is not high They are just talking nonsense about the processor . The integrated 985 has a better comprehensive experience than the plug  in 994 . Even though the 994 has a higher running score than the 985 , the actual use of the plug  in is not as good as the integrated one . Android is as smooth now , and it s still the same after more than a year use . The same , 7P has been used for four years , and it s really stuck  laugh cry  when I was searching for something in class yesterday , it could nt come up with a word for a long time , and my classmates even asked me why it was so stuck . It should nt be , my mother s 6SP is not very stuck when she uses it now . Before , WeChat was very stuck . I updated the system for her once and it was normal . Anyway , my Apple Last one and this one are all stuck when used for more than three years . I have cleared all the chat records , there are still 80 GB left in the memory .  White eyes  It s not always stuck , just sometimes . There will be no caller ID for a short time after the boot , and the ringtones will be reset or somethinglaughs cry  Not the same , different requirements for apps , general needs are really no problem , but like me who use a lot of apps , Huawei mate I use super lag and crash  sad  Most of the crash are caused by software or incompatibility . Now the RAM all is up to 10 g , it is impossible to get stuck . In terms of smoothness , it is already a new era . Is there any reference value for using more than a year .... If a flagship start to stuck after using for only more than a year ... How can it be called flagship ? Nowadays , most people replace their mobile phones with new ones every one or two years . If it were nt for the feel , I would never have picked the iPhone . Now charging , heat , signal is driving me crazy For feel , better to choose OV iphone 12mini invincible Single card , poor battery life Except for these disadvantages are all advantages Right  DOGE  Only my 13pro has poor battery life ?  allow sad  Just replace the automatic 5 g with the independent 5 g , nsa is the technology that is eliminated , the 5gsa signal is good , the speed is fast , nsa can make you mad What s the difference between automatic 5 G and 5 G enabled ? A 5 g switch , a 5 g mode , what difference do you say 5 g all the time is definitely better than when you automatically switch back and forth all the time I m always on 4 g My 13PM power consumption is also fast  Sleep  The problem of the baseband , The appearance of the se3 is exactly the same as that of the se2 , both are 4.7 inches , but the battery life is too poor How long has it been since the 13mini was released , is nt the slap in the face loud enough ? 13mini is also bad in my eyes  DOGE  But he is small , my friend . If you do nt look at the size , you compare with the ipad , even your promax ca nt win . The battery of the se is about to be more than 2,000 mAh . It is already very good to have that battery life of the 13mini . I have a se2 , I do nt usually use it to play games , it s totally okay for daily use . Even if you make a phone call half a day , it s fine . The fisrt 10  are durable . I just use WeChat , the battery is at most half a day  allow sad  , before se2 can swipe Weibo and Bilibili , and now the battery is really bad The battery life of the a15 should be acceptable , but it s 2022 , still the old  fashioned 169 screen looks a bit weird At the same time , I am using the K40 pro and iPhone 13 . Except for taking pictures , the K40 is really not bad . K40 is very stuckAnyway , mine is stuck to use Very smooth , especially after upgrading to MIUI13 Know something about rainbow screen  Yun Bei   Yun Bei   Yun Bei  Mine is normal Wangxiaobaila The improvement is not big , the perception is not obvious  doge  The appearance is not good , it still need 888doge  3500 s 11p top match , it s real good  doge  Can I say it s a little ugly ?  Yunbei  Wearing a phone case is the same 10pro fights for another year , 13 good Indeed  Eat melon  Why not buy 13mini directly ? Face ID wearing a mask to unlock payment is too troublesome However , the overall experience of Face ID is better . I m using 12mini , unlock silky smooth When I first bought the 13mini , I also hoped it can be the main machine It s hard to accept the camera The camera is too ugly , I do nt like the notch Unhappy to see the notch What are the disadvantages of Apple s camera compared to Android ? Compared with the flagship machine , there is no advantage Or what are the shortcomings of Apple s photography ? Such as sharpening serious ? The sharpening is serious , the color is getting stronger and stronger , the picture is not clean , the algorith m is not good Apple s video recording is better , but taking pictures is more realistic . The bottom is too small , the night scene is not good Do nt guess  shy  , if it s cheaper than Xiaomi 12 , attractive I hope it s cheap . I resist not buying Xiaomi 12PRO . A watched pot never boils The GT2 Pro has no telephoto and the main camera is not good enough . In other aspects , it is totally strong . It depends on the price . I feel that the price is definitely cheaper than Xiaomi . Otherwise , how can it fight against Xiaomi ? After all , this brand is not as well  known as Xiaomi . Many people do nt know what this is .  Yun sad   Yun sad  I only knew this brand this year Make it clear  laugh but say  , is it cheaper than Xiaomi Mi 12 or 12pro  laughing without a word   laughing without a word   laughing without a word  Xiaomi Mi 12 , the overall configuration is not as good as 12 Pro . Double  cell capacity is discounted , and the decay is faster You may not understand yet , dual batteries do take up more space , and then we gave you 4700mAh , is nt it enough ? Can 9p be bought within 5500 ?  doge  Baking fire?Continue to bake fire , must be bought in 6000 Dual battery power down fast Where did you hear that the dual batteries lose power quickly . . Lei Jun said at the press conference yesterday  laughs cry  The dual  cell battery I used by the green factory is indeed worse than the single  cell battery life of other companies . After using reno ace for 10 months , the battery life is obviously not as good as before , and the perception is obvious After spending money on various flagship machines , such as Xiaomi , Samsung , Huawei , Apple , OnePlus , Meizu , etc . , I looked down upon these machines . After playing CIVI the day before yesterday , I decided to buy it . The parameters are really virtual , and the experience is real . I think online people are the easiest to be deceived . They study various parameters and watch various tests , all of which are data experience . civi is ok , I also used it , because someone around me buys it , I often use it to play games , the touch and weight are very good The main thing is that it is thin and light . It has everything that should be there , and the price is OK . I am using 13p now . There are too many places to complain . Hahahaha , what s wrong with 13p I think 8848 is more awesome  laughs without speaking  I have never used 8848 , I have used too many mobile phones , I feel that many things are meaningless and the direction is wrong . Zhanbao , if you pick me , I will replace Mi 9 with 12pro  doge   Yunbei  In addition to the battery and taking pictures , 9 is not bad Okay , 3000 lasted for 3 years In fact , it was not okay a long time ago  tears  Now I go out and directly turn on the power saving mode , and I dare not play the game How many times a day do you charge ?  doge  How about using Mi 12 ? Is the battery enough ? Is it overheat ? Snapdragon 8 peak power consumption 11.2Wdoge  Mi 9 battery really ca nt work Lei Jun After so many years , there is no excuse to struggle anymore Unlike Xiaobai s assessment , his 13 is only 7 hours , yours is 9 hours , awesome . I feel that Xiaobai is the most worthless test . How many hours does your magic 3 last Charge twice a day . pretty bad To be honest , I ve been using 13pro max for a month . I do nt play games , just look at Weibo , Xiaohongshu and WeChat , bright screen for 11 hours is no problem  doge  Test items are different Find N can produce boldly  Yunbei  The find12 g memory version seems to be 8999 , this fast charging chip FSB and screen size are stronger than oppo 12  512 , Honor is 2000 more expensive , OPPO s Samsung screen , UTG glass , hinge is also OPPO much better , hovering , shallow crease You are talking about the small box of the p50 leading the way , this is probably not  a lot  better , and the internal screen Samsung external screen Zhou Dongyu , both has no dc dimming , the external screen ratio is strange and still 60hz , the Honor one is all diamond  like , ppi does not impact and the refresh rate is high and 19 20hz dimming , it is still a new chip , the oppo is 888 , 8g1 is better than 888 anyway Android version of Hongmeng  12 G start  new generation of Snapdragon 8 feels better than oppo I prefer OPPO s size and screen look and feel , as well as free hovering , no accidental crease is OPPO wins , too  doge  Without testing , I really do nt have much time to play games in daily life . If I really play games , I would consider buying a Microsoft or Sony game console . I would just buy it based on my personal needs , if you pursue the gaming battery life experience , buy a Pro Max definitely the best It is mainly the ios system account of the glory of the king , the android system ca nt play , otherwise I have changed to game phone early  allow sad  I guess that the post host is similar Stan Bell  It s already possible to transfer across systems The upper limit is prompted every time I apply . I do nt know if there are any skills . When will the battery capacity data be available ? I like the small screen very much , but the battery life of the small 7 I am using is too bad , I am really afraid It does nt make much sense to look at the capacity . The official website does give the battery life . It is the same as the previous generation , only the pro is a little less . If MINI can have a battery life like XR , it will be awesome Why do I feel like throwing up  Do you think others have never used s8 ?  UnexplainedUnexplained  Look at your name What s wrong with the name , the problem you mentioned , is the problem of dusk not being solved ? How come mine did nt get dust , even if it does nt get dust , will you bought one   Smile  After all , you are the one who bought the 16s pro , let s not mention how is this machine , what we are talking about is the hot topic now , it s useless for you to tell me these things , you have to let Meizu speak to implement it solve . Secondly , look at how much I hate Meizu now , and how much I liked Meizu in the past . Those eight or nine units were all bought at the original price , hahahahaha That feel , curvature , display effect is invincible The s8 is good , my classmate is using it , it feels very good , but the post host s statement is too nauseating Look at my name , I just want everyone to scold me I say  experience  , you say  picture quality  The best camera experience should be the third generation of sony 1 Blogger  I told you about the four flagships , you told me about sony ? I was wrong Ahahahahaha It s true that Huawei s camera and video experience is not good , what you see is not what you get  two ha  870 sold to 3799 , stupid tax machine ceiling find x3 said what are you talking about ? I want to buy x3 , may I ask what is bad about x3 ?  Er Ha  There are basically no telephotos in recent machine . It s basically perfect if you do nt really care about motors . personal opinion . Is nt the 8gen1 of Xiaomi 12 more stupid tax ceiling ? Do you think 8gen1 and 888 are better than 870 ?  laugh ha ha   laugh ha ha   laugh ha ha  Qualcomm is  , sons have to lick it I know , thank you son  Starting Season  Did I means you ? I suggest you scold people after you understand them  In fact , findx3 is currently the best in the 870 , and it feels very good . If the appearance is acceptable , x3 is really worth it Is nt the battery life of X3 really bad ? Not so bad as you said for light use . You have to pick the flaws and there is no perfect phone . Just saying that the main configuration x3 is indeed a good machine in the 870 System processor xr beats mate20 It s useless , as a mobile phone , even the most basic signal is failed Did you use it ? It s happening all over the world , whether I use it or not , it s a fact . That s right . There are only systems and processors . Other aspects are beaten by Mate20Pro Huawei s fans also think that Apple only has a good processor and system , do nt talk if you have nt used it , really , shameful Not used ? How do you know I have nt used it ? Do nt you feel ashamed to say that ? Then basically all other points are defeated by mate20pro 15w wireless , 40w wired , ip68 , camera , frame ... All in the price But Meizu really has no conscience . Just look at 18pro and iqoo8pro you will know . Recommended to several friends The box is also included in the price , do nt pack it I feel the same way . Like other manufacturers , there are many offline stores . After making a reservation directly , go to the offline store , change the card , take the machine and leave . iqoo8p uses a better ultrasonic fingerprint for better photography . The price is the same as the Meizu 18p , the top  equipped 5999 Even buying realme is better than buying that Redmi , the system is good , the appearance is good , and have high cost performance system ? Is that the one who was updated only in half a year and became an abandoned one in two years ? Do you want to use the bug ui that fly left and fly right and the locked screen wallpaper displays the number of steps ?  Jerry  A few example of bugs and official announcements of only updated in half a year , I choose the first one . Those who bought realme on Double 11 may have already past half a year s upgrade , and they will be abandoned when they buy it .  calling  Just be happy The system is disgusting to kill you , the system updates are cut in various ways , every two months is a perfunctory update , the memory is not enough , the 8 G memory can only use 3 G , the charging is slower , the battery life is not good , I will not buy the real me any more  handheld x50Pro   , hope you do nt fall into the pit Then buy iqoo realme s system really suck  Khan  I also agree , whoever buys realme will regret it The screen is small , but the thickness is not small , and it does nt feel as comfortable as the civi  s. The feeling of scrub is weird  Yun Sad  12 feels more textured , and civi has a plastic feel to the touch compare with it . The civi feels better and is made of glass , which is similar to the feel of the purple Mi 12 . This is also where civi has an advantage The main thing is that the civi is too light , there is an unreal feeling , the 12 is a bit sturdy , and I feel that the weight is just right in my hand , and the 12p I have ordered does not feel good now . civi does feel good in hand and looks good , I thought 12 would be on par with civi , but it did nt . The Xiaomi Mi 12 feels like it is small in size and swollen around the waist . It feels like a little fat man . It is not as good as Xiaomi civi , which gives the feeling of a thin and slender waist . Relatively speaking , Xiaomi civi has a better feel . It seems that there should be more people who buy Xiaomi 12pro later . Its hand feel is more normal . Because of the increase in screen size , the disadvantage in thickness is reduced , and the hand feel becomes more balanced and comfortable . How about buying K40 now ?  Laughs cry  I bought the K40 game enhanced version two days ago , it feels really easy to use and smooth , and the charging is fast . From the morning to now , at the standby , it is less than 7 hours , and the screen time is more than three hours . Now the remaining power is 70  . Will it get hot if I just swipe video without playing games ? I also want to buy a spare machine . Many games are on Android , and this 855 in my hand ca nt carry them a bit . I basically do nt play any game , even do nt play once a month . If you play games frequently , this phone may not be suitable . How about buying K30s now ? If there is a new intact , it s okay  provided that you have to accept the weight , thickness and the bad display frame rate scheduling of the new version of the firmware  Oh , okay , I feel this battery life will be more comfortable  hug  There is one thing to say , I saw the gossip that the price of K40 will increase   Is it after the release of the k50 standard version  doge  It may be the same as the K20Pro , the price will increase before the delisting How about 12Pro battery life ? Have nt tested yet , will get results tomorrow Then wait for your results , see the Xiaomi community it is not very optimistic  I pay more attention to battery life and smoothness . I did nt dare to open the phone when I saw the comments , and I was ready to return it if it is bad .  to bow  There is no need to tangle so much with a mobile phone , just open it and use it . If it does nt work , sell it out and change something else It is screwed up , the bright screen lasts 4  5 at most , unless you turn 90hz or 60hz on Return it It is recommended to try the pro and promax series , it will give you a new perspective on 1 The signal is really bad What carrier are you using , I use mobile and it feels good Telecom  Unicom I agree with this point , but I am currently using 11 , and the signal is really poor  Yun Bei  A little more people , then no signal , speechless This happened where there are many people or the signal is weak . It ca nt be helped , an old problem . To be honest , among all mobile phone brands , Huawei s signal is okay , and other Androids are also average . The Samsung s21 in my hand is only better than Apple  s. 13pm battery life is good , the signal really bad How about buying Apple 11 now ? Not using 5G. If you ca nt stand the oled screen flash , you can choose 11 . I think that 11 , 12 , and 13 are almost the same . I bought an iQOOneo5 , I ca nt stand this garbage screen That is too rubbish , iqoo n5 , the Samsung 20fe I bought is ok It s a good deal , it s good to buy unlocked or second  hand when you buy it now How about 11Pro ? Is there any advantage to use ? There is really no advantage , the battery life is too bad . The mobile phone is small and feels good , it may be the only advantage . The black border is too big , the main problem is the signal Whether 12mini is a single card or dual card , mainly because I have this requirement , I think the signal is ok , the XR used before , the signal is OK        Do nt think about 12mini , single card  Allow Sadness  Battery life is poor . My previous 11 the signal is not very good . It is hot to play games in summer . After using it for less than a year , I want to sell it in xianyu  tears  This phone is very nice and the price is too Is the price of 8999 still nice ?  Allow sad  Is nt this nice ? The first folding screen below 10,000 yuan ? Trivia , Samsung Z Flip3 , the initial selling price is 7599  dogedogedoge  but the main value of this phone is appearance , only 3300 mAh battery  Snapdragon 888 , it is still a bit hard to be the main phone The price is also unbelievable badhit call  Good lord , the taste is heavy enough  doge  OPPO s texture and workmanship are unmatched It s really good , my boyfriend now uses Find X3 , I feel very good All I can say is that this design does nt have white , I do nt know what the product manager thinks . There are too many flagship phones without white . The all mate30 series has no white , or even a lighter color . Is nt it still sold ?  eat melon  Mate40 looks better , also has white I m just giving an example that it does nt have to have black and white  eat melon  Will there be a ceramic white special edition in the future ? Launched BB later Oneplus five , it s been used for more than 3 years , and it works very well . The same oneplus five , ready to replace 9 next year , except for the memory remaining 10  , the battery is worse than before , the other is no problem , ready to restore the factory settings and continue to fight , I hope it can last until the 9 comes out next year Mine too , it ran out of memory some time ago , I deleted some photos then it s okay , and the battery I always felt the same way , no obvious change The main 8 T really does nt make me want to buy it , I only like black phones  laugh cry  I m also confused , how can I change the machine if it does nt get stuck ? Change 9  DOGE  next year Yes , insert 5 G card , part of data traffic , part of WIFI Can it come out tonight ?  laughing without a word   laughing without a word  waiting online , very urgent  laugh cry  To test 2 times to verify , strive for  LikeLikeLike  No matter how late , I will wait for you  laugh but say   laugh but say   laugh but say  I do nt believe that the X60 baseband also has a special Apple TSMC version  doge  The power consumption of the baseband radio frequency is the same for everyone , and it is real , maybe Apple s power consumption is a little more , since Apple has always had a bad signal . It should be tested like this , which is the closest to the actual usage scenario . Xiaomi s bad experience , they are really lack of attention The Honor screen and external playback are still too bad . Although Xiaomi ca nt tune it well , the hardware is really good . If you can tune it , it will be very easy to use . And after the enhanced version of miui came out , many problems were solved , and the experience was much better than before . Facts have proved that Xiaomi did nt care at all Blame Jin Fan , I really do nt know what he thinks , miui has never been like this before . Miui started to be bad since Leijun did nt care about miui , and various reforms have not been done well . Once Lei Jun took care of it , he solved a lot of problems . ay .. you say they pay no attention , other departments are working hard , and even the routers which was so bad in the early days had a turnaround overnight . Honor is good ? Sanctimonious , it used to play the patriotism card , but now the chip ca nt be used , and it has turned be to a flatterer of Qualcomm . The screen , memory , motor , photography , and system are all low  end configurations that remain unchanged for thousands of years . Is this what you mean by a good experience ? Magic UI does not have the same bad experience as MIUI . Why does Xiaomi occupy no matter how good the configuration parameters are , but what level of tuning is it in the end ? The bottom haha , really ? There are all you water army on the internet to send the dirt . You have the final say in everything , and you have nt used it in the experience store  spit   haha  Play5 t is really not good Regardless of this , the flagship Magic3 Pro and the Ultimate Edition are much better than the Xiaomi experience . I want to have a straight screen , Dimensity 2000 , preferably the kind of phone with optical zoom I hope the battery is 5000mAh with 66W fast charging , and the screen is better with nfc . The CPU should not be lower than MediaTek 1200 . So much demand for batteries I m using a note 10 and it s already 5000mAh . It s just that the screen is poor and the memory is a little small . I still do nt think the battery life is enough Next year will have , the price of mobile phone chips is keep rising . The price of domestic mobile phone manufacturers is close to the limit . In order to maintain profits , it is necessary to increase the use of MediaTek chips . Therefore , there will be many 2000 series mobile phones next year , with prices around 3000 . MediaTek has also increased the price , so the machine with 2000 is also going to 4000 price After 4 hours of bright screen , there is still 39 left , which is basically very bad . Xiaomi s last 20  power consumption is very fast .  sweat  Come , take a 2k120hz model that is not bad and let us open our eyes Let the engineer check it out and fix the problem , is that okay ? I am currently using the 11 series , and the overheat of the daily use is really hard to stand . It is better to find out the key to the problem and solve it as soon as possible , and it can also improve our experience . Why not do it ?  eat melon  Are you sure that any problem can be fixed and optimized by engineers ? For the so  called battery life optimization , you should take a good model with 2k120hz optimization out . Do you understand what is an objective factor ? Anyway , you just ca nt see that it have been played the game for two hours , and do nt even think about turning on 120hz . Who does nt turn on 120hz ? Funny ? You do nt believe the  general  ? What does two hour game mean ? The 5000 battery like this is already very general . What about the OnePlus 9pro on the third floor ?  eat melon  60  battery lef after 4 hours with two hours of games  eat melon  Recently , the Mi 10U has been replaced by the standard 13 . After using it for a few days , it feels a little waste of money . There is no substantial improvement , and the camera is still backward . It feels like a waste of money to replace Xiaomi 11Pro with Apple 13 I originally bought the iPhone 11 as a backup machine . After a few days of using , the full  screen gestures was really annoying . After using MIUI , I really could nt go back . Although it is unstable now , it is still easy to use . It s a bit difficult to switch to an iPhone . , now it s one year to change one , wait for Xiaomi 12 Ay , Xiaomi s full screen is really good You can change to 13p , but it s no need to change 13 Expensive . . . Forget it , have bought it already . Apple s current camera is the worst of all flagships  doge  I ca nt stand the torture of 888 recently . I bought a 13 to dual  holding with 11u on Double Eleven600 . To take pictures and watch videos , I still have to use 11u  ErhaErha  and compare with 11u s 2k Samsung screen , 13 s screen is too bad  Erha  I m dual  wielding 13 and 10U  doge  now . May I ask which one is your WeChat on ? The 10U screen is no better than the 13 , but it s bigger , and it s a bit uncomfortable to change to a smaller screen . But I turned 10U into entertainment , for taking pictures , and iphone for work . Yuhai Lanedk  I think the 12pro is a little better and the screen is better The same screen ... But Xiaomi Adaptive High Brush Know something about DC dimming Taking pictures beat gn5 I admit that imx707 is stronger than gn5 . You have to admit that the micro cloud platform is better than ois . Do nt forget that the third lens iqoo also supports ois . Xiaomi seems to be only the main camera . How could it  beat  ? As long as the anti  shake is good , it is good to take pictures ? The lens quality gn5 is several grades worse than 707 . the same specifications screen , how could it be better ? Xiaomi Mi 12pro adaptive high brush ? This is also adaptive LTPO2.0 This R angle is still awkward To be honest , the experience of the Xiaomi 9 model is the best one in the Xiaomi series . Unfortunately , the power is too small Are you sure that droplet is serious ... I really do nt think there is anything wrong with the water droplets . On the contrary , I think the water droplets are very good . The R angle of the four curved surfaces is generally not as round as the hyperboloid , and it is better to make the hyperboloid  laugh ha halaugh ha halaugh ha ha  It s better to make a straight screen The frame of the straight screen can not be narrowed . Am I the only one who thinks it s good ? I do nt feel embarrassed by 11u s r angle , I ca nt even find it everyday  Yunbei  only you Did you use it ? Come to the Internet to argue cloud  DOGE  Mr. Lu , a lot of Mi fan have a little opinion on the use of Dimensity 9000 for the super cup . I think 9000 is perfect for super large cups . Snapdragon sucks 5000 battery 11pro battery life is too poor 11 is the fire  breathing Snapdragon , right ? I also want the Dimensity 9000 for the super cup . Forget the fire Snapdragon . If you want to buy the Snapdragon , you can choose Xiaomi  laughs but does not speak  K50 standard version 870 , e  sports version Snapdragon 8 , pro Dimensity 8000 , pro  Dimensity 9000 seems to be like this Only have opinions on the use of Snapdragon in the super cup Redmi charging is not slow , only taking pictures is not good K30Pro expresses dissatisfaction of taking pictures  doge  Rely on Google Camera to lift , Google Camera yyds I directly installed the Google version 8.2 of cc9Pro , which is stronger than the Google algorith m of k30Pro and has more functions  hee hee  I personally do nt consider about taking pictures when I buy redmi , it can scan the code is enough  allow sadallow sadallow saddoge   Hush  Is 10u worth buying now ? It s worth , based on this year s flagship performance , you can buy it and use it for another year The battery life of the k30u I use now is really outrageous . It need to be charged three or four times a day . I do nt know what to change now K30U is bad of course Not so good What else is there except the screen ? Overheat and battery life I just bought one , I feel very comfortable  doge  How long has it been used and how fast is the charging ? It has been used for about 10 days , and the charging is very fast . After all , I switched from the charging speed of 30w , and it can be fully charged from 0 to 100  in 30 minutes . Mate 40 series  two ha  What s the big difference between 40 and 40pro ? The Pro s processor , screen , charging , waterproof rating , face unlock , camera are all better Okay , thank you  Win Milk  Which one is better in 40 and 40pro  bitter  If you have enough budget , definitely go for Pro The M40 series is too strong  Doge  Xiaomi Mi 5 was also overheat back then , was it 808 or 802 ? Mi 5 is 820 , I happened used it , and it feels calm and smooth  laughs without saying a word  , but it may be because I used Sansang S7e before that , it was really hot and stuck , so I have this contrast feeling . . I used it in the summer at that time , the electricity dropped very fast , and then it was very hot without the air conditioner . If I walked outside , it would burn my legs . The charging is very hot and ca nt be used . The 820 generation chip is not cool anyway , the battery of Xiaomi Mi 5 is not big , and the heat dissipation configuration is average  the starting price of 1999 was still under control at that time  The 800 , 801 , 808 , 810 , 820 , 845 of the year , which is not hot , Xiaomi 4 , Xiaomi note , Xiaomi 4s , Xiaomi 5 , and Xiaomi mix2s , all are overheating , the 835 of Xiaomi 6 is a little better , and Xiaomi 9 is also slightly hot Qualcomm s good cpu is only 835 , 855 and 865  allow sad  The Xiaomi Mi 5MIUI8 of the Snapdragon 820 is considered the only one , but MIUI9 is much better later I also forgot which miui it is , it was used for nearly a year , and it was stolen in 2014 Mate40Pro is estimated to be the top flagship this year.doge  The performance is slightly worse and the charging is slower . However , if it is only based on daily use and not based on extreme performance , I still call 40PP the strongest flagship in 2022  School Season  Then , I leave???doge   doge   doge   doge  Porsche hardware does not seem to be as good as Pro  doge  but the appearance is the most domineering in recent yearsdoge   doge  A little more overheating than Pro Mine is M40Pro ... the charging is ok . . . Wired 66 , wireless 50 , enough . Especially when I see my sister and my brother  in  law using the iPhone ... it s too enough  hee hee   doge  There is a circle of Apple around , I want to laugh when I look at it , it s useless of scanning the code so fast , there is no signal I think the silver version of p40peo is still very good  looking even now  dogedoge  Both have  Doge  Apart from the small size and good feel , nothing else good . It is recommended to replace 13pro with 13pro max . 12 pm battery life is quite average , 13pm battery life is fine  Doge  1Sell 12 pm , replace it with 13pm , the difference is quite obvious  haha  ...... Forget it . I used the 12 Pro Max for a while last year , and I could nt like it . The battery life is good , and it s good in all aspects , but it s too big . The overall configuration of the vivo X80 entry version is higher than the Green Factory X5 , and even higher than that of the Xiaomi 12 . I said overall , not every item Taking pictures is better than them . The chip is Dimensity 9000 , which is stronger than x5 s 888 . The screen is Samsung e51080p . These three points are indeed better than them . It is hard to say other places . The three core configurations of the mobile phone , the camera , the screen , and the processor are all strong , and the others do not matter . The screen just Samsung does nt sell , but the current e  series has also greatly exceeded the needs of normal use , so the impact is not great mi12 this year will definitely repeat the status quo that the mi10 product force was crushed by find the previous year  eat melon  unless findx5 is not even as good as x3 It feels like 12 is learning Samsung s s number  doge  It feels like it has always been the best for taking pictures Not all mobile phone users like Apple s closed system . In terms of system convenience , Android is better Not all mobile phone users like the bells and whistles of Android , in terms of ease of use , ios is better To transfer movies from a computer to a mobile phone , Android does not need to install anything or transcode , but what about Apple ? Just acting as a mobile hard disk , how many people will transfer movies to mobile phones ? But it does nt affect me using two phones  dogedogedoge  ok , nobled note9Pro users  too happy   Eat melon   Eat melon   Eat melon  agree There are enough users of MIUI , and there will be more feedback for the appearance of bugs , so that MIUI will be smoother and easier to use , and there will has fewer and fewer bugs . However , Meizu s sales have declined in recent years , the loss of users , and no more people to participate in the feedback of the system . Flyme is behind MIUI in this  But I still hope that Meizu will catch up . After all , the design aesthetics of the Meizu 16 return to beat the Mi 8 , with fine workmanship and excellent quality  2698 has COP packaging technology , which is rare  There are tens of millions of Flyme users , and MIUI users mainly rely on Redmi . Which one says bug ? The user groups are different , and it has no conscience to say that Flyme is backward Before the release of Meizu 16 , in addition to Redmi , Xiaomi s mobile phone sales have surpassed that of Meizu , because Meizu had a conflict with Qualcomm before , and it had a good relationship with MediaTek , so the sales were bleak , so the previous Flyme the number of users is declining , not as good as MIUI users , but this time the return of 16 has truly achieved a counterattack How many new users can 16 attract ? Users are dependent on the accumulation of time . The sales volume of low  end machines does not affect the number of users , and the registered users do not change much It because they do not act . The previous bugs are always being followed up . Should be fixed as well , right ? After all , the Flyme system was comparable to MIUI back then Boss Lei I tested the glory of the king at 120 frames . It was really 120 frames throughout the whole process , and the phone was only 41 degrees , which was very comfortable . Xiaomi s optimization is good , much better than my The light of Android . There is no need to post every Weibo , the glory of King 120 FPS , 870 processor can stabilize 120 all the way . Not to mention the new 8  black line  888 is the most rubbish . 870 is 105  112 . Ca nt get up 120 When I first bought 11ultra , it can also 90doge  now 45 You wait to say that again in summer , my Xiaomi Mi 11 is already useless . Mi 12 is really awesome , its appearance , performance , and photography are all very good  The iQOO system is very smooth and the animation is good OK , I ll try it after released I have iQOO7 . neo5 . note20u . s21u . Fold3 , iqoo for gaming . The 1.0 version of the iQOO system is okay . There are a lot of small bugs , but the overall experience is good . I do nt know if it will be better to upgrade to 2.0 Should I buy fold3 or wait for s22u ? Is it possible for the straight  screen iQOO 9 to have the same width on all four sides ? The straight  screen iQOO9 is estimated to be a domestic screen . Holding 12mini , going to buy PRO  Jerry  Same mini , tangled between p and pm , there are only two hours left Considering pm , you must have a need for battery life , then pm  Jerry  I think it s too big and heavy , but I m afraid p s battery life will not work Holding 11 , I m going to buy the mini macho pink tonight , I love small size phones so much  wink  In addition to the dual card , this generation is also a full version of the mini , worth to buy  Jerry  1 S22U battery is bigger , charging faster , taking better photos , the screen is still new material , the system can be updated to One UI 8.0  School SeasonSchool Season  s22u Snapdragon 8gen1 is more likely to explode Even 888 did nt explode , still afraid of 8gen1 ?  sad  Hahaha , but it s a bit scary when it s hot I do nt know about the u series , but the s22 s22  is really shrinking from the s20 . Too difficult , I thought it would get better and better , but I did nt expect it to start castrating the storage and the screen Since Lv Taiwen came to power , except for U , everything else has shrunk . It is completely sold with the configuration of the mid  range machine . The super cup is the real S  School Season  Your expression does nt match When is 8.0 coming ?  eat melon  Are you fishing ?  two ha   Eating melon  The picture has been deleted and I m posting it again . If it ca nt work again , you can go to the Bingyuzhou Weibo to search for  update   too happy  Yes , it can be compared with the OPPO one , you can be tangled  allow sad  It s true that oppo charging and chip is not good , Honor camera should be not good None is good . If nothing else , both the main camera is 766 , there is no big difference Fast charging , processor , diamond  like arrangement screen , taking pictures on the folding screen is second only to x2 , a larger screen has a better ratio , can your findn compare ? All not good ? Funny OPPO 60Hz 33W  Dig nose  What s so good about a folding screen without free suspension , the playability is much less Did nt Zhong Wenze say in that video that it could levitate ? Still need to tangled ? There is no comparison , OPP Snapdragon 888 Honor latest 8Ga1 I feel that the cost of these two is different , but the experience is not much different . If I buy note20u now , is it out of time ? I do nt play games I still like the shape of the s21u . I did nt buy it for more than 6,000 on Double Eleven last year . I regret it very much . It s right if you did nt buy it . It feels heavy in daily use , and the fever is very serious in the early stage of playing games .  Tan Shou  It s not as good as 10  if you really want to buy one  Yun Bei   Yun Bei   Yun Bei  , then 618 look at S22  Like square and upright , 20U is no problem . If not , do nt you think the design of this 22plus is beautiful  tears   speaking of note20U , you can see the appearance of 22U this year , I feel that 20U can be used for a few more years , believe me , if you have never used Samsung , it is absolutely amazing  If you buy online , do nt buy parallel imports  thanks It s ok if you do nt play games , the front is exactly the same as the 22u , the performance is enough to use , I still use the S10  Taking pictures is much better than this  dig nose  Hahahaha , awesome , this remark , no matter how bad my 11u is , it seems to be the top level for taking pictures . Even ca nt compare to x60Pro  black line  How can it not be compared ? Tell me Are you talking about taking pictures ? It s bad , but not too much , right ? Did you get it ? Have you compared before you said too much    I really got it  Smile  Good , goodThen you tell me how much  But this is not as good as k40 , k40 12  256 is less than 1900 , and the screen is Samsung  s. Charging is almost the same as 67w The texture of the k40 is not comparable to this Depends on what it is used for . Playing games on a straight screen is definitely more comfortable than a curved screen . If college students are in the dormitory , k40 is more practical than this It s really bad , the Samsung leftover screen of the k40 is terrible There are actually many professional tests about screen evaluation . Not to mention the test , my parents use k40 and I use 11u myself , I think the difference is only in the resolution . Garbage or not , there are many test videos for reference The feel is different , I will wait for 618 to buy 12x  allow sad  The whole series of Xiaomi Mi 12 is really good in craftsmanship . The transition between the middle frame and the screen is really good Come on , I have been using the s10  Forerunner for three years  doge  is still smooth , I will upgrade oneui4.0 next month and it can fight for another two years  laugh cry   doge  The tenth generation is ahead of the times It is indeed too much ahead of other models  laugh cry  The s10 has been used for nearly 3 years . The battery and charging are the flaws . Others are fine . I changed the battery once  laugh cry  I feel that I will use it for another two years without any problem , mainly because I bought a tabs7  in the previous paragraph , and the budget for buying an s22u is not enough After using a high refresh rate mobile phone , I feel that the S10 is a bit stuck  laugh cry  I use it normally , I do nt feel the lag  laugh cry  and I m still a heavy mobile phone user It is said that the OnePlus 8 system is pretty good , and the OnePlus 9 uses the vivo system , I do nt know how is it . I have a co  worker who uses one plus 8 It use OPPO s system , OnePlus has nothing to do with vivo  dogedoge  Oh , remember wrong , sorry  doge  However , the predecessors were all BBK ? OPPO , right ? Many people do nt like Hydrogen OS , but most people like ColorOS , so it should be a good thing to replace this one now . I also considered Xiaomi Mi 11U , but it is a bit heavy , and seeing the camera optimization seems to be complained by a lot of people , after all , with such a good hardware , the picture is sometimes good and sometimes bad , plus it is too heavy , so I did nt considered it , then there is only one plus  allow sad  How many years can the iPhone 13 promax be nailed ?  dogedogedoge  If you do nt dislike taking pictures too bad , ID is too ugly , at least 5 years  doge  Taking pictures too bad ? ? ? Can you shoot 50 times with the Apple ? If you plan to wait until it ca nt update the latest system , I guess it can be used for 5 years . If you plan to wait for depreciating and then trade  in the old one , 3 years . No problem in three years Different opinions on the appearance design  OPPO dual batteries are faster , Xiaomi s is relatively slow  Xiaomi wins in terms of weight and feel  cameras are both 766 , and will wait for the follow  up test and comparison  about system , coloros12 is said to be stable , and Xiaomi need to wait for the performance of miui13 . The screen , Xiaomi s diamond arrangement 12bit color depth , 1100nit brightness dynamic refresh rate screen , although it is domestic , but it should not be worse than OPPO s Samsung e3 screen ... OPPO wins in terms of price . There is no absolute cost  effective About hand feel , I do nt agree The Xiaomi Mi 12 is almost the same size as the Meizu 18 in your and my hands Is the thickness and weight the same , too ?  glutton  It really depends on MIUI13 and comprehensive experience . The existing gap in parameters is not worth the premium of seven or eight hundred , but if the experience is good enough , it means buying the experience  doge  , which means that Xiaomi has indeed turned to the high  end direction , turned to the direction of hw and Apple , focusing on the direction of experience , rather than the direction of parameter stacking and price surprises . Of course , 618 is estimated that there is still some room for price reduction , and there is a discount if you buy it later . It would be wise to wait until 618 to buy . Unfortunately , the phone I use now only has 64 memory , so I ca nt wait . If 12x is 300 cheaper , it is definitely the first choice The Master Explorer Edition is about the same weight as the 12x 7 g difference Mi 11 s wifi ca nt be turned on , and it crashes when I click it . I went offline to test it today . After flashing it , it was fine . At that time , I thought it was fine , too . But when I came back at night , it appeared again . Should I go 100 kilometers to flash the machine every day ? It has been used for almost a year , and this situation has just occurred for two days , how to solve it ? I bought the Mi 11 for my wife s younger brother , but after using it for 5 months , it could not be turned on . I went to the after  sale service and they said the motherboard was burnt . After waiting for ten days , they did nt change the motherboard because it was out of stock . They do nt replace new one , I m disappointed in Xiaomi I have been using it for almost a year and I have been seeing other people s reactions to this problem . I thought it was an isolated phenomenon . Now I feel it is only a matter of time to bburn the motherboard . Do nt they change yours for a new one ? My Xiaomi Mi 11 also started to have the problem that WiFi disappeared and WiFi could not be turned on after the automatic shutdown a few days ago . It has occurred several times in the past few days , and I am really speechless . Change one I m here I m here , Tutu attaches great importance to your question , you can tell me anything , Tutu has sent you a private message , please check your private message when it is convenient Stop launching the LCD screen of the note 10 Pro . Is that LCD not good ? The screen is quite dark , never seen such a dark screen I tried it , change the low value resistor , increase the screen voltage , it will be better  doge  Note 10 pro s lcd screen is very good to use Top flagship screen OPPO FindX5 , the more I look , the more I like it  doge  Holding the x3 , it really looks better than the picture , and it feels great in the hand Mainly because it is too knockoff  allow sad  That s true , when it first came out , it was 4500 . I also scolded it like Apple when it with a case . But when it drops to 3000 , there is no disadvantage  allow sad  the rear camera module does look like ip I hope that the X5 series can use the X  axis linear motor this time , do nt shrink on the motor , it really affect the experience  doge  The X5 has been determined to use X  axis the whole series , and is quite big  eat melon  It has been tuned wellDoge   Doge   Doge  This comparison is basically no problem . Apple s screen ca nt beat a bunch of others like those years , and the battery life is also very poor . Xiaomi camera has not said that it is better than Apple , but actually below pro , Apple s photography is really average , only the A15 and the system are really strong . . Do you think there is anything wrong with this comparison ? But the question is how do you know it is average ? On what basis ? You did nt get the results from watching the test video , did you ? Sorry , Xiaomi 2 6 , 10 , 11 , iPhone , 6 and later , have basically been used for about half a year . There are many people in my family , and everyone has more than one mobile phone , we often used interchangeably . Is there any problem ? If it were nt for the redmi on your homepage , I would have believed it  eat melon  Poor battery life ? Do you know how strong the battery life of the 13 generation  doge  Furthermore , the Mi comparison method does not mean that make the loser be the winner , but deliberately choose some areas where it have advantages but are not obvious , and force itself to be equal to other s disadvantages . . Such as this x  axis motor , such as ip68 waterproof I recommend that you watch less tests and use it for yourself before talking about battery life . The previous 12 was not worthy of mentioning the battery life at all , and now the 13 is just qualified to mention the battery life . Structured light and ip68 are not used to compare , the motor above is at least a street better than Xiaomi The X motor is indeed , the size determines the feel of the vibration . Apple s interaction is really good , but there is absolutely no crushing advantage . It is nothing more than Apple s larger , uniform vibration and good software interaction . This is a system problem . What about 12pro ? I m afraid that the max is too big for girls to use Pro if you like to take pictures , ok if you do nt take pictures very often Hmm , I decided to buy a pro at night , wo nt be tangled anymore Sure . If you want small one , buy pro , if you want big one , buy max , I plan to buy pro I want to buy pro but a lot of reviews say that pro is the worst deal The cost performance ratio of Pro is too low . It s only a few hundred dollars less than promax . Either 12 or pm . The pro is really nothing more than the 12 , only the rear camera is stronger and the price is more expensive for more than a thousand dollars . If you do nt care about cost performance and you care about the rear camera configuration , the pro is also fine . 12pro is the lowest price  performance ratio . The mini is afraid that the battery life will be too bad , so I feel that these two are not worth . Can a 3000mAh battery work ? The Xiaomi Mi 9 is only 1080 and 4 G , the battery life is also bad . The battery life of this 2 K screen and 5 G network must be worse  Allow sad  Is nt it more than 3800 ? 13 and 13pro are 3085  Doge  Nonsense , 13pro is over 4 , even 13mini is more than 2800 It is said that the battery life is two hours longer than 12 pm Battery capacity 3085  Doge  Let s wait until the first wave of user experience comes out . Apple says it s better than 12 pm , but I still feel unbelievable . 256 , the photo is good , 3000 , can you name one ? X60 Samsung processor need nt be considered first , is x60 good for taking pictures ? . . . The x60 series takes pictures is straight and narrow 3000 only 766 is ok . Manufacturers will not adjust the mid and low end Is the 766ois of the master exploration version not worthy ? One plus 9RT s 256 is only 3100 Did nt oppo just launch a self  developed image npu a few days ago ?  doge  In this way , the shortcomings of MediaTek s only competing product are gone  It is difficult to ride the fire Snapdragon , why do they have to ride it ? Will only the pro version use self  developed npu  laughing  That s definitely not the case . The research and development costs are so high that only selling the pro will be a loss . The find series has not sold very much , the standard version will definitely use . It s better to sell more It s not just used this time and it wo nt be used again . . . In the future , if the cost is recovered , it can be gradually delegated to the sub  flagship , and the flagship will use the latest and better one . What I mean is , is it possible that in order to differentiate , the standard version if you want to buy a slightly cheaper one , and the pro version if you want to take better pictures ? This year s x3 series standard version is almost the same as the pro version , the photos are exactly the same , only the processor has been upgraded from 870 to 888 , and it ca nt arouse my desire to buy a pro at all  two ha  And ISP In fact , this generation of Dimensity ISP is not bad ... What about GPU  Doge  120W is good , note11 series configuration is average , still Dimensity 920 is garbage , do nt buy it It s okay if do nt play games , the configuration of Reno6 is the same Do nt listen to Laoba nonsense . To be honest , the price is very kind . At present , it is the top version . If you do nt play games , standard version also has multi  functions , but other brands do nt have . configuration , I think it s worth it I have used it for a year , is it burnt ? You understand everything  Doge  At that time , all machines of Android were stuck , except Apple . What should be said or not , the iPhone X and Mi 6 both were better than it at the time Have you ever used Mi 6 ? How do you know it s not stuck ? There is nothing out of nothing . Honor 10 , 970 processor is also not weak . My v10 is very smooth . Coincidentally , I have a v10 in my hand . My best buddy in high school uses the Mi 6 . During the third year of high school , I used his mobile phone to play the glory of king and became Challenger . I have no right to speak ? Am I smearing ? When was that time ? The Honor 10 was 2018 mobile phone , and the Mi 6 was already released for a year , still talk about stuck ? Honor seems to be 970 , 970 is not stuck . From 970 , Kirin is fine It s really behind . The p50 is castrated even compared to the p40 . I have to say that the 700 has maintained the level of the first echelon for so long . I really think it s outrageous , Huawei s algorith m on the p50Pro is too strong , stronger than the mate40Pro  tears  Guessing the wrong word is also called strong algorithm ? ? ? If you try it yourself , you will know . You can only have fun with the advertisements on the Internet . There are people who really believe in it  Khan  But P50 taking pictures is better than P40 Negative optimization , mpp has been blurred like an oil painting machine  Tears  In fact , it is a psychological effect . It has been tested by uploader , and there is no negative optimization  doge  P50 does not seem to be 700 Honor s rear camera is really ugly , that two flounder rear cameras are big and abrupt . As for the screen , Honor helped everyone get to know  Zhou Dongyu Arrangement  before . Do nt compare the screen with others . After all , the screen is bought by the supplier . Their  screen lottery  before , did nt they know ? The problem is , before the Honor screen was not good , everyone scolded it , and I also scolded it because I bought the Honor rag screen . But when it comes to Xiaomi , it is not allowed to scold ? Besides , we did nt say that Xiaomi s screen is bad , it s just that something is worse than Honor . It s okay to scold . I just think a brand that uses a mix of screens , and the quality of the screen also requires a lottery by consumers , is talking about the screen materials with others , which is rather funny . As for whose screen is bad , KOLs will come up with a result after a while Do you mean that Honor can be scolded when it uses a garbage screen , but ca nt be praised when it has improved and use a better screen ? And another brand can be boasted about its good screen in the first two years  most of the people I follow , including me also agree that the screen of Xiaomi Mi 10.11 is very good  , but when this one lose , it ca nt be scolded ? It s a bit too double standard , this is just a normal comparison , why not ? At least it is indicated that the mixed use , do you know that the media machine of a certain company is directly different from the machine purchased by the user ? I do nt allow you to say that to Gree , oh no , it s Little Pepper , oh no , it s BBK , oh no , BBK is gone now . Oh no , then iphone  laugh cry  The zhizhen version is pretty cool Bought . . . It s okay not to play games . Daily use is ok . The only good thing about the whole machine is that there is no plastic bracket for the straight screen 2k . The Snapdragon 8 is too bad , it is really frustrating to play games  two ha  Realme s optimization is really average . Play the glory of Kings 120 experience is not as good as the 60 . Do not follow hands . My previous Xiaomi Mi 12 is also like this . The point is that the game performance is garbage , and it overheat seriously . After all , cheap Bought at 4299  doge  it is not cheap . Pay for the only direct screen 2k Otherwise , how could Huawei s global sales beat Apple for so long ? This is strength . The most ironic thing is that Xiaomi also followed Huawei and defeated Apple in the third quarter of global sales . Huawei relies on low  end phones to boost sales You do nt know the global ranking  Huawei s 5 g technology lead the world and surpass the United States ? Now Huawei s 5 G mobile phone sales are the first , accounting for more than half of China s 5 G mobile phone market . Now Huawei s 5 G is already the third generation , and Apple is the first generation . Which is low  end , anyone with a brain will understand Using redmi made your brain damage Now in Weibo , when comparing sales , do you not distinguish between price segments ? The profit is high and the sales volume is so low , does nt that mean that there are many fools buying apples ? Besides , you can look at the online big data survey and analysis  1 . The profit of Android high  end machines is not lower than that of Apple  2 . The sales volume is low , I do nt know where you read the data , and only the same price is comparable 3 . People who say what it is stupid to buy Apple or buy other brands are the most stupid  4 . You call this picture data analysis , you are so never seen life and uneducated Later , the profit was still Apple s highest . At the same time , it also shows that the fools who buy Apple are the most . After all , the sales volume is so low , but the profit is high . However , the battery and signal are so poor that it is not comparable to those of the domestic 1000  yuan machine , which fully confirms the words on the internet that most of the people who buy Apple are paying stupid tax .  Yun sad  I also think you are right . Buying a 100 yuan dumbphone which has the best signal . But I think it depends on the region . It is really not suitable for Apple in remote areas . The Android software is too rough and not suitable for office workers . But the battery life is better than the Mi 12 series  dogedogedoge  Can the mini also say that the battery life is good ?  thinking   thinking  13mini is really good It s not bad , but even if the 12 gives up a 120 , the mini battery life is still not as good as it  thinking   thinking  There is a battery life test on Xiaobai s Weibo  allow sad  There is a big gap between the test and the real use . In addition , you need to figure out the needs of the mini user group . Theoretical data where the battery life of 13mini goes , you can see for yourself . Take the K40 game version as an example . In the case of daily use , I charge it once a day and a half , and the total screen  on time exceeds 10h  two ha  Die of laughter , you said that the Pro is better than the 12 is enough , why do you also say that the mini battery life is good  two ha  The funny thing is the high  end series of coarse grains , not you , the battery of more than 4000 was beaten by 2000 , and it was stuck  dogedoge  Where did you see being beaten by 2000 , let me see  too happy  Huawei is awesome , have to accept Apart from the fact that my p20 s power drop a little faster , it does nt get stuck at all , I ca nt find a reason to change to a new phone  kneeling  Replace the battery , it costs 61 yuan at the service day May I ask ... What is the service day ? I see that the p20 battery in the Huawei mall costs 99  doge  Share a smelly thing  my Huawei P40Pro soaked in the cesspool for a whole hour , and after I picked it up , it was like playing with it in my hand , nothing happened . Did it take an hour to pick it up ? No , it s the kind of toilet that ca nt be flushed . The big slate is pressed down , there s no way to pick it , I had to find someone , and it took an hour . My dad s p9 is with me , and it feels quite smooth to use now  laugh cry  P9 does not support upgrading Hongmeng , only supports to the batch of Kirin 960 It s already a product from n years ago , and it s already good if it s not stuck . The feel and appearance of the x60tpro are very good , and the photos are also very good , but the single speaker is a bit uncomfortable , and the battery life is also very general  allow sad  Very poor battery life It s already the best battery life mobile phone in vivo among this more than a year . It s really hard to bear charging n times in one dayangry  The battery life is actually not particularly bad , mainly because the 888 mobile phone does not have good battery life .  Allow sad  The appearance and the feel is better than the x70pp , and the camera is only a little weaker . It s pretty good . The screen is average , and the speaker is indeed a flaw I switched from iQOONEo5 to x60tpro , the experience of external playback and battery life was obviously degraded , but other than these two points , other aspects are very good As OnePlus 9pro user , I want to say that the battery life of this phone is really poor , and the camera is really one of the worst in the flagship . The price cut is too fast , and I do nt plan to buy any OnePlus phone again . It s all because my colleague was fooling me . Is it better to use this money to buy other flagships ?  Allow sad  How many hours for heavy use ? Going out to play and take pictures for more than half a day , the battery is almost out of power . I do nt play games , I have nt noticed it , but watching videos is also drop power with a speed that can be seen by the naked eye  tears  Is nt this generation 888 all this level ? Yes , it is better to buy Mi 11u or Apple with some extra money . I bought this on impulse at the time , but it feels really good . OnePlus , a mobile phone that can only be bought once in a lifetime  Love you  Buy iqoo8pro now or wait for the next generation  disappointed  If it s just for playing games , wait for 9 . For comprehensive experience , 8Pro is the flagship . Of course , 9Pro is also okay  two ha  Let s wait for 898 to come out and see , if it really does nt work , after the release of 9 , it s not bad to buy 8Pro then  allow sad  I just want comprehensive experience  the school season  . I think that Taobao coupons can be used on Double Eleven , it can be cheaper by a few hundred  disappointment  Will the price drop after that , or do you still recommend other mobile phones below 5,000 . I occasionally play games , want to take better pictures , and have more memory , can be used for three or four years .  School season  IQOO8PRO Double11 4699 is very attractive Are you in a hurry ? I m not in a hurry , I feel this one can still hold on for some time That you can wait Even mobile phones with big bangs can be boasted like this , ca nt believe it That s because you only see the bangs  Dig nose  I just mentioned the most obvious shortcomings , poor signal and slow charging are the facts . My colleague recently bought the iPhone 12 , and the signal is so bad that he doubts his life , saying that Huawei has never encountered it before , although I do nt use Apple or Huawei silent  It s all downsides , why can sales still surpass Huawei s  Black Line  There are still so many people buying it with big bangs . Do you want to say that everyone else is stupid and rich but only you are sober ?  doge  People who buy iPhones are really stupid and rich . Does that need to be said ?  laughs silently  Look how good you are , look how sober you are , oops The frog in the well is pitiful To be honest , this is also the case when the Dami test the p40pro , but that video has not been deleted . Screen rubbish is rubbish ,  people have the right to speak  The problem is , he s not like Dami , and he is bit of misleading deliberately Dami does nt mislead people , eh ? Was nt the oleophobic layer flying all over the sky brought about by Dami ?  Tears  It is the fault of consumers do nt understand Huawei that the 10,000  dollar flagship does not have an oleophobic layer  tears   tears   tears  No need to whitewash . It s almost the same . Dami said that the Mate40Pro has a better texture than the Honor Magic3Pro , so it was deleted by the Honor according to the Civil Code . The reviewer has a video that is very obvious . What Dami said is purely subjective . Have some brains , please Six of one , half a dozen of the other . Dami said that Mate40Pro has better temperament than Magic3Pro and was deleted by Honor . According to what you have before , you should buy 12Pro or 12Pro Max Change Pro Compare the configuration , if it is 11 now , it is more cost  effective to change to 12 , or 12pro max . The price difference between 12 and 12pro is 800 , and the performance is not much improved . There is a big difference between 12pro and 12pro max taking pictures . 12 should be the same sales champion as 11  . Either high or low , summary   heart  12pro max and iphone12 , choose one . thank you . However , the max 6.7 is a bit big for me , and I am afraid that it will be uncomfortable to hold on the right  angle side . At that time , when I got 11promax , I felt that it was thicker than xsmax . If I changed it to 12 , I felt that there was no need to change it . I just care about the feeling , I like the 6.1 pro . If I were a boy , I might use max But 11 is really not as easy to use as xsmax . I bought it for a transition . Now I am going to change to 12 . The pro is too small , the promax is too heavy , the max I bought first was returned and replaced by 11 Someone actually likes Android s camera  Puzzled  I feel that Huawei s photos are weird After using Huawei P30 for two years , the portraits are getting blurry  tears  You can try wiping the lens with a wet wipe ?  Erha  It is said that the oleophobic layer on the surface of the lens has fallen off due to prolonged use Still the same , the front is really not good And Huawei is a Hongmeng system now ?  Yunbei  is not an Android When there is only one Huawei in the Android camp ?  two ha  The Xiaomi used by my family is easy to break in one or two years , and the quality is really not good . In the current situation that the performance of mobile phones is all fine , Xiaomi really make me have no desire to buy it . My Mi 6 has entered the fifth year , the Mi 4 has also been used for several years , because the memory was not enough , but it did nt broken . But the Honor 3c I used , the motherboard was broken when I woke up , maybe the first generation product is inferior  just stating the facts  Honor 3C . Now mine can still be turned on , and Xiaomi Mi 3 ca nt be turned on for many years  My 3c was fine at night , but I do nt know what happened the next morning that the motherboard was broken . Each generation of products always has good or bad quality The xiaomi or redmi used by my family can be used for at least 5 years . My mix2 has been used for 4 years , and it is still smooth like flying . I have bought a lot of Xiaomiand redmi for my family to use . Basically , after two or three years of use , I bought them new ones before replacing them , and none of them broke . Two iPhone12 The battery life is not good , the photo is general  cracked  Add some money to buy 13Pro  Doge  100 million some ?  doge  No matter what , it is better to take better pictures The iPhone s photo is not bad  Laughing Cry  The quality of the film at the same price is almost the worst , the highlight is not good , and the dark part is not good . At night , it has its own watermark , and sometimes the sharpening is very serious . At the same price , the ultra  wide telephoto will be even worse  allow sad  Do you want your parents to lose contact  eat melon  It s not that I have nt used it , it s a bit too much to say that lost contact . The heat of Meizu 18 is uncontrollable  allow sad  but the game performance is good , ov Mi are hot and the frame rate is unstable  allow sad  but the temperature of Meizu is slightly lower  allow sad  Is 17 s 865 better ? I think it s okay , anyway , playing the King of Glory basically does nt drop the frame , and playing games in summer is also hot . The indoor is basically okay , the outdoor is a bit serious , but the main point is that the photo is a bit poor . In fact , I quite recommend you to buy a cooling back clip . Whether it is Meizu or ovmi , the game experience will be much better . Going to Xianyu to buy a second  hand one should be less than 100 yuan The frame drop is too serious , I am going to sell it , and it is even overheat when taking pictures  tears  The ov freeze and drop frame is serious , the one plus 9p I bought before is also , basically say goodbye to the game The phone you bought is just not suitable for gaming . . . And 888 is fire Snapdragon , except for game phones with cooling back clips , they ca nt hold back Yes , even the previous generation of mate30p ca nt beat  tears  I have no requirements for the processor , enough to use is okay  I only need to dig a hole in the middle of 3.2 mm , and narrow four borders  The back center camera module  Plus , the upper and lower symmetrical dual speakers  Perfect  This white one can basically score 9.9  dogedogedoge   dogedogedoge   come on   Doge  Make one like this with under screen , invincible The mass production cost of the under  screen camera is too high  Users do nt buy it either  Unless the cost of mass production under the screen comes down  It may come out later  There should be no possibility of such a design in at least two years  Xiaomi MIX must still be a curved body , and it feels good  If you want this kind of screen , you have to look forward to ov , Apple , but Apple s under  screen will not be had in 2 years . About ov , if Apple do nt have , why should I have it      , so this border is unlikely But redmi is about to make under screendoge  This phone , ca nt be made , the frame is too narrow , it ca nt pass the drop test You re so funny  This is the rendering  Which mass  produced machine have you seen that is exactly the same as ppi .      I also made a comment based on the mobile phone in the picture you want  dogedoge  Who knows you are not delusional  dogedoge  The camera is too big , I just use it to scan the code  Doge  Tongtong , look at the MIUI13 of my MIX2 coming  dogedogedoge  My mix2s is still alive , but the battery ca nt work  two ha  Change battery at activity Okay , my mix2 has already been changed to mi10 Change the battery if there is activity mix2s really wants to go to 13  tears  but the partition has not been expanded and ca nt do it  allow sad  It s been 3 years , I can consider shutting down , my mix2s has always had small bugs recently OnePlus is emboldened to mock Xiaomi , because Xiaomi s design is very general , much worse than Huawei ov , OnePlus  design is more international , and its aesthetic taste is on the same level as Apple , Samsung , and Huawei , higher than ov  s. Of course , It s really a matter of politeness , and it should nt be so straightforward . OnePlus has the confidence to mock Xiaomi ? You said that ordinary Xiaomi phones without design is fine , but do nt forget that Xiaomi s top design is on the mix series , the same generation of Mix completely beats OnePlus Xiaomi can only rest on Mix laurels now . Last year , Xiaomi 10pro s same ag technology is indeed worse than 8pro s design . It s not that OnePlus is better . Xiaomi s design in the past two years does have room for improvement . Even if it does nt compare with OnePlus , it has no advantage in appearance compared with oppo and vivo . If Xiaomi s design improves , it will be perfect . If the price is high enough , it will not be bad . In the past , because of price constraints , could only compromise . Now do nt need it . I am optimistic about the products in the future . To be honest , there is no domestic design is good , except Huawei . Oneplus 9 copied reno copied Apple this time , even worse than Xiaomi 11 Xiaomi s back cover imitates Apple s 1112 standard version , the traces are obvious You see Xiaomi with a mobile phone case , it is completely Apple Do nt mention OnePlus , does OnePlus have any in nova tive designs ? The one plus 5 generation is the same as the oppo I m using iPhone 8 , and it can still be used without upgrading the system , but it will get hot when playing games , so I ca nt use it for a long time . The battery is not good , my 8 battery is running low It s already dead , change the battery and continue to use it I feel that it ca nt work even change the battery , haha , I ca nt use it without the power bank X upgrade to 14 has no problem . I plan to upgrade to 15 . 8 and X has the same processor , do nt worry about the upgrade A friend of mine upgraded from 8p to 14 , and complained that it was stuck , so I think no . Apple play games is always not good , 11 and 12 playing games are all overheating , down  clocking , and freeze . Why is Huawei so light and has good battery life ? Huawei P40 Pro is more than 200 grams , P40 Pro is more than 220 grams , do nt mention the normal version of P40 , the castration is too large . mate30pro 180 g 4500mh is nt it ? Bad battery life ? m30p is not 198 g ? It s not too light The battery of mate30 is 500 less , how good could the battery life is ? The p40 is also not light , and there are no dual speakers Mate30pro ? How about FindX2Pro  Doge  I just started to use it , the texture of the ceramic is as warm as I said before , and for the weight , the subjective feeling is slightly heavier than the previous generation . As for the others , I need to use first It s better when you re there . The find series became too common after you quit .  Yun sad  After findx2 came out , it was the same group of people who said that it was too expensive not to buy it and said that there s no find after the eyebrows were gone  eat melon  The price is too expensive 6999 Indeed , if the top match is 5499  5999 , and there is a high probability that the sales will go up . I do nt know if the top version of x5 will exceed 7000 this time . I bought it during it initial launch  Doge  Looking at the appearance of OnePlus 10 Pro now , is it pleasing to the eye ?  laughs silently  This mobile phone is a good  looking type , the more I look at it , the more I think it looks better  laughs cry  But it may not be easy to match the phone case Use it without cases  Smiling  Well , it s much more pleasing to the eye than when I first saw it , but it s still not what I like . I have an obsessive  compulsive disorder , and I do nt like this kind of irregularity . Mainly I do nt like digging holes in the upper left corner , I like the center Yes , for the obsessive  compulsive me , I also like to be centered . Or the symmetrical kind , I do nt like weird ones . Green is good  looking , but I ca nt let go of that black part . Maybe the feeling of a patch is preconceived . Green is more chic and more attractive  doge  It is said as if everyone are going to buy it . Anyway ,  xiaomi12  I have already supported  heart  Envy , I hope that there will be a white or silver one later , I should have saved enough money by then  Yunbei  Is the iPhone not good to use  DOGE  The small iPhone is suitable as a spare machine . For the main machine Apple is no longer attractive . The charging and hand feel are average , especially when compared with Xiaomi , it is not cost  effective . Bro please follow up with a user experience  doge  Okay You still dare to buy the initial launch  Yun Sad  Must support it  haha  Holding the Redmi K40 , it is not as power  efficient as the Honor 20Pro two years ago This is nonsense , you can compare it with the previous feature phone , the feature phone has nothing , it can be used for 3 days Why is the Redmi K40 less durable than the x50Pro smaller battery ? Is the k40 better than the x50Pro ? It is very one  sided . Some people use a lot of power , while others use a small power consumption . It depends on how you use it . Of course , there are system optimizations . There are also some versions of vivo that consume a lot of power . You can only compare the Honor 20 Pro two years ago Honor 20Pro beats you Redmi k20Pro in the same period 12Pro Max is 2778  1284 Wake up ...... A sentence reveals that you do nt understand mobile phones . According to your calculation , is my Samsung 32001440 3k screen ? I did nt say 2k , but it s not 1080 either . Is there a sense of superiority with Samsung ?  Question  If I do nt have a sense of superiority with Samsung , what can I use to have a sense of superiority ? The top  level camera screen , sound quality , waterproof appearance and workmanship , all top  notch , or you use a mobile phone that does not even have a refresh rate of 120 to have a sense of superiority . Since I used Samsung , I look back at my 11max and it is a ppt mobile phone Apple has no 2 K screen now , Picture comment About six years ago , not long before the 820 was released ?  doge  I feel pretty good about the 820 . It was the 820 when I first came into contact with phone . I did nt feel very hot . I used it in summer . It s not good at all . I ve used Mi 5 , Mi 5s , Samsung s7 , it s stuck and always overheat and the battery life is poor . The fluency is not as good as the mate8 and p9 of the same period . They are still emmc . I have used all three you mentioned , and I have also used Le 2max zuk z2 , Mi 5 is my favorite , it is thin and light , and the feel is good , I have used three different versions before and after , and I have also used mate8 p9 . They are all used to play the glory of king , and I did nt feel too hot in summer . It s far away from the 11 11p 11u I used last year . Besides , Huawei of the same year play the glory of king is garbage , and the performance is not good , only the temperature is not high is useless The 820 and 821 are both bad , and it is a little better than the 810 , far less than the Orion 8890 of the same period 8890 is the real peak of Orion  Allow sad  The current Orion is really not good Yes , I m still using it as a spare machine  laughs cry  Almost at that point in time ... the time of the last time it screwed up After the 820 rolled over , it showed them the way to overtake , right ?  laughs but does nt speak  It was Qualcomm flop for 2 years in a row  810  820  what make the people in mtk felt that there was a chance . They did nt expect that Qualcomm would flop for 2 consecutive years twice . Huawei 4400 battery , Samsung 5000 battery , 9000 power consumption is big ? Samsung is 2K120hz , Huawei is 1.5K90hz Marginal effect ah , the two points you mentioned have little effect A certain 11 also has better battery life  two ha  2k 120hz and a larger screen . Battery 200mah bigger A certain 11 is not the Samsung one , Samsung is a global 120hz adaptation . 2k120Hz , these two phones do not see the same picture , how to compare ? Control the variables , ok ? Then OP s 65w totally beats 666768 Do nt be so absolute , I have a 65w surpervooc and a 67w miturbo , almost the same , the mi s battery is still bigger than the o s It s easy to see the difference after a year It does nt matter much , as long as they are dual cells , the speed is almost the same , the actual capacity of the single cell is higher than that of the dual cell after one year , and the loss of the dual cell is higher . If you want to comparre in this way , the higher the loss , the faster the charging , and the battery is smaller , the o must be faster than Mi . So if you compare one year later , it s not rigorous at all . O  Plus s 65W beats Xiaomi 67W , but Xiaomi 33W beats a certain 66W  Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   DogeDoge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge   Doge  66w can only say that the full load time is too short , and it takes so long to be fully charged It can also be compared to some 120  laugh cry  So , which one is the strongest in terms of photography within 3000 ? I do nt know within 3000 , but around 3000 , find x3 is the best  doge  Battery life is a problem . ? Is nt the battery life better than Xiaomi civi ?  Thinking  At least at some ordinary battery life levels . Some boast that no optimization and no algorithm 2,000  level garbage k30pro s imx686 is stronger than 766 . If you refute it , you will be blacklisted . It s enough for everyone to know the species of your stuff . That maggot has already been blacklisted , low  energy species  love you  It seems that I found out late  Yunbei  Redmi K30Proz  Doge  Poor k30 , at this price I feel that only the 766 of the Master Exploration Edition is stronger There s no need to talk to this Mi fan . As soon as we mentions the point , he will brag and blacklist others . It s so funny . Even imx686 is so bad he was still bragging it . 766 is no better than 686 in his mind .  Tan Shou  The crimson red of s22u looks a bit like purple  cherry in the video , and it looks good . But it feels like there is no motivation to change . Start buying Note9 is because watching the memories of Alhambra . Note10  is because of the back shell with LED breathing light . In fact , I like Note 10  very much . I switched to 20U because I heard that it is the last Note . As a result , the Note now  returns  in the way of the S22U . But it s not called Note , and I m starting to like folding screens  hee hee  . I first started s6edge just because I watched Descendants of the Sun , but at that time , Samsung s localization was too bad , so I changed it . I used s21u and fold2 on a whim at 2020 . The folding screen is really very unuseful at present , and it is heavy and large , but the gray of this s22u is hard not to impressLove you  My first Samsung was bought because I watch  You re Beautiful  , and I used it for a year or two change to an iPhone . I bought the S6edge in 2016 for taking pictures and looking good , but the curved screen at that time was not easy to use . I did nt buy Samsung for a few years until the Note9 came out . After watching the photos of the S22 series in the past two days , I am a little touched about the S22U again . I have used the s21u , and after watching the s22u , I feel that there is almost no improvement compared to the previous generation , but I really love the appearance . The s21u gives me a very general experience . In fact , the dual  machine people has nothing to do with folding screen , the folding screen is also ca nt do what two phones can do The same , watch the drama in love with the Samsung The same Korean drama fanSamsung fan That s true . Recently , I wanted to buy a spare machine , and I was struggling with which one is better . I was thinking about whether to buy an xr or 13 , and then use my 11pro Max as a spare . If you want to have a good battery life , it must be the XR 13 has twice the battery life of the XR There is such a thing , anyway , I used Xr before , and now I use 13pro , the battery life is ridiculously poor The spare one must be Apple and Android dual  wield Then still 13 So embarrassing , you scold oppo but use vivo , do nt you know these two phones are similar , and the phone you use is just more than 4,000 , I laughed  It s a lot of different , and he s not scolding vivo . After all , this color is really ugly . Vivo s more than 4,000 models are also easy to use . It can be charged once every two days , and it will be full in 1.5 hours . It s also very good It s almost the same , they ve been competing with each other all the time . I ve used vivo and oppo , and it s almost the same . A lot of people around me buy r11s . Even if they have 4,000 yuan , they wo nt buy a new vivo model .  ErhaThey are two of a kind . No one is forcing you to buy it . What s the point of sarcasm here ? You say that vivo is good , and some people say that oppo is good . If it does nt work well , why does Yang Mi use it ? We all know that Yang Mi often uses oppo Hehe , you have nt watched TV or what ? Yang Mi used to be the spokesperson of OPPO . If she does nt use OPPO , then why she endorse it . It s none of my business if you have 4,000 yuan or you want to buy which mobile phone . I bought it with your money or what ? I have two mobile phones , thank you , go to my profile to see  yawn   yawn  Two similar mobile phones , do you know how the promotion is introduced ? Vivo oppo is from the same manufacturer .  Er Ha  No matter how many phones you have . Besides , the choice of mobile phone is the freedom of others .. Oppo this one s pixel is indeed better than vivo s , vivo s face  lifting is too fake , I ve used this one , I ve also used vivo . All Android phones are similar , so why s there to scold One plus 9 Pro of 3799 , I used it for two days , I feel really good  doge  How about the battery life Battery life does nt work well . I went out with a full battery at 800 in the morning , and I used the navigation for about an hour on the back and forth , and then I kept going shopping and taking photos . During the period , I chatted on WeChat , and listened to music for 20 minutes . When I came back at 300 in the afternoon , there was only 17  . I ve been shopping all the time , and it s basically a light use , and it ca nt hold on for a day . If I go out to play a few games , it would shut down for half a day . I turn on WiFi , Bluetooth , positioning , NFC , 5 G for traffic all the way  Yunbei  That s too difficult , I feel like it s not enough to use Is the system ok ?  doge  Wo nt it freeze after three or five months ? That s not it , now it s OPPO s color OS , and now it s Color OS 11 . It seems that the official version of 12 will be released at the end of the month . OPPO s maintenance system is fine . Is 1  with oppo system ? I have nt used it and I really do nt know  doge  It s all about making up the numbers . Why do they make such a big camera decoration ? After all , it s still single camera Looks pretty good  doge  This 30 plus looks better , you can buy a P50 for 1000 yuan Bad processor  doge  suitable for girls and offline Oh my god , this back is so pretty ?  be surprised  Today released mate40 light luxury version and p50 pro light luxury version  dogedoge  p50 pro light luxury version is better looking God , I actually think the texture on the back is kind of nice This is the Mithril color scheme of the mate40  doge  The rotor motor , the front camera is very bad , the rear camera preview is very blurry , but it s okay after shooting . The machine is big and heavy Apple really might as well save some motor volume and improve heat dissipation . Although it s not hot at all iPhone13 does not need heat dissipation  doge  , a15 is too strong , the daily use temperature is much lower than Android , no heating without playing games or charging , but unfortunately killing the background is serious and there is no high refresh rate , otherwise I will not change the 865 machine The background is stable . It s still hot after playing large games for a long time , but it s much better than Android . Plus , it s invincible if add the cooling and increase charging . Of course , I am mainly not used to the iOS system . It is better to has small functional as Android . Apple is much more cost  effective than Android . Android flagships are not cheap . 13 The background is unstable . I used to use the 12 pm , the background was fine . 13 kills the background is too serious , and there is no high refresh rate . The iPhone 12 is often so hot in summer that it reduces screen brightness . I ca nt see it outdoors at all  ErhaErhaErhaErha  13promax is much better than 12promax and basically not hot . The gen1 machine is very hot I said 12 hot , you told me that 13 is not hot as 12 ? And then you said gen1 ? Am I going to tell you that X is also hot ?  Er Ha  The baseband is made of 5lpe process , it is impossible not to be hot  doge  accumulation of heat dissipation is useless Xiaomi Mi 12Pro , everything is just right , just a little more expensive  two ha  Scheduling garbage Buying that mobile phone is also light gamers , and the serious players buys black shark red magic or the cheaper black shark 4 or redmi k50 g When did the glory of the king become a heavy game , the picture quality of 90 has not been opened to full height , and the 60 frames ca nt be stabilized , it sucks  Erha  If there is no 8475 in the second half of the year , I will change to 12p , but when I think that Qualcomm will change its process in the second half of the year , it is really not worth spending 5,000 to buy a 12p  slap in the face  Pinduoduo 4500 There was a magic sale before the new year , 12  256 for 4699 , but I did nt catch up And the Samsung S22 , with a four equal widths screen , and the body is so small  two ha  But the battery life sucks  DOGE  Playing games even 8gen1 is not good , but the battery life is very good when not playing games .  Laughing but not speaking  It can be said that it is very good , anyway , this one is very good for me I was determined not to use apples before , but I already bought apples ...  Cracked  When I switched to Android three years ago , I sneered at Apple . I bought 13 this year , looking at Android , and I m really not interested in any of them In the past , I used Apple , and then I changed to Huawei mate20p , and last year I changed to 40p . . . In the future , it is estimated that it will be Apple again , and Huawei will be gone . Ay , Hongmeng is actually really good , smooth and stable , and a lot of practical functions that meet my work and life needs . If Samsung use Hongmeng , I will definitely buy it . Apple does not have call recording , fast charging , long screen capture , remote control , nor property elevators access control can be used , and many work software are not supported , so I am really tangled  erhaerhaerha  Can you tolerate this signal and charging speed ? After I changed the apple , I found that the apple is really good  Allow Sad  The factory system of iQOO Neo5s is Origin Ocean , I feel the experience is slightly better than my vivo X70 Pro , and the functions are more complete . Sure enough , the original is good  Yun Sad  original is good The vivo X70 is still a public beta version , wait for the stable version to be released I wait Is it a new system ? Yes , the latest Origin 2.0 system , that is , Ocean Hope 2.0 will improve the battery life If you feel that his system experience is not better than your vivo X70 , how about taking pictures compared to this ? The vivo X70 Pro currently has no rival for taking pictures Very good Z5 is very balanced . No problem . This price will be a little hard to beat 1749 s k40 top  equipped 12  256  School Season  What is DC lighting ? See the dc introduction of the magician Danzong , directly search on Weibo How to buy 12  256 of 1749 , I see it s 1949 now Go to  What s Worth Buying  to see , wait the lowest price of JD Is K40 easy to use ? I bought it for my family before , except taking pictures is not that good , the others are very good . Now after upgrading miui13 , you can turn on dc dimming in the developer options , 1749 buy the top version is very worthwhile Have you ever used Meizu mobile phones ? I have used MX4 MX5 Note3 Note6 16thPlus and now holding 17pro  Haha  Same  Ha ha  I have used the Meizu pro6  doge  ring flash , it has a perfect feel , but unfortunately the processor of MediaTek will only get hot and drop the frame when playing the glory of King  Unexplainable  Pro has the best appearance and feel I have used now , but unfortunately MediaTek I ve been using it all the time , but I do nt know if I ll have a chance again  pick nose  My mate20Pro has been used for 35 months  if I count correctly  cracked   Three years , is it running slow now ? Smooth  Doge   Doge  Haha yes , now a good Android phone , it is really not stuck after using it for a long time My Huawei p20pro is 40 months old , I wanted to wait for the iPhone 15 , but the screen was broken two days ago , and I replaced it with an assembled screen , which is not so sensitive . I want to change my phone . ah ah ah , ca nt wait for Apple 15 Why do nt you change to the original ? It s been more than two years , there is no problem , but the memory is not enough  Single Dog  Next time I will get 512 G  doge  You can officially upgrade the memory stick , or you can add a memory card yourself The problems you mentioned are exactly the problems of Xiaomi Mi 10P  Cracked  Mi 10P signal is really bad Sweety , regarding the problem of poor mobile phone signal , the specific solution has been sent to you by private message , take a look when you have time The customer service is really hard , I feel like you ve been taking the blame for your mobile phone department  Doraemon is afraid  What is the signal of 10U No money for a new one , I used 10P  bitter   Yun Bei   Yun Bei   Yun Bei   Yun Bei  The K30Pro Z axis is strong ? It seems to be quite strong , anyway , it is a good z  axis adjustment What about the Samsung Miracle s compare with the True Flagship s Totally beat the same period s20 Feels strong , but not too crisp It is not good after updating the system , miui11 was very good The price  performance ratio is not as good as Motorola , the system is not as good as vivo , and now Xiaomi is getting worse and worse  two ha  The price  performance ratio is not as good as Motorola ? You really do nt understand price  performance ratio . No matter how bad the system is , it is still the first echelon . If you have used vivo , you will know how bad it is Sure enough , Xiaomi users I am an ipad user now , and I still have Apple bucket and Oppo bucket . Is it enough ?  doge  And about cost  effectiveness . You probably forgot that Xiaomi has a son named Redmi .dogedogedogedogedoge870 has reached 1700 yuan 888  1799 ...  Allow sad  870 is much more stable than 888   dig nose  You have to buy Motorola Hahaha are you angry ? really protect your master Hahaha It s not that the small screen is unacceptable , it is estimated that the battery life and the single card make the problem The battery life of the 13mini is okay . 4 G positioning and bluetooth are fully turned on , automatic brightness , my screen time is about 5 and a half hours every day , and with full wifi can reach 6 hours  doge  This is stronger than the 5000mah of 8gen1 Then others charge to back blood for 20 minutes , you need 2 hours It does nt take two hours . It s almost 80  in one hour . The battery life of the 13mini has improved a lot compared to the previous generation , and there is no problem to use it as the main machine . I also said that most people , I do nt care  please forgive  That proves not true love , how can it be perfect Yes , so I am the exception  doge  1999 is too beggar , 2899 is just ok , almost the same level as gt master Laugh to death , the master exploration version should be compared with k40 No , the master exploration version is very good to take pictures , and it wo nt wind up the same as more than 1,000 yuan s camera . Come on , you have nt used it anyway , I just saw a user saying that it s bad for taking pictures . gt really ca nt compare with 12x , 4 x memory , photo castration , e3 screen is estimated to be at the level of Xiaomi 10 , heat dissipation , craftsmanship , mainly the body , gorilla glass five . It feels a little bit stronger than the master in all aspects , maybe the sound quality and motor are better , too . Analyze as a former user of gt master exploration version , who buys fc uckme then who is nt , the experience is really bad until I sell the phone . Xiaomi has many bugs , but at least it is better than it How about the high refresh rate of the 13pro It is clear to you that Apple s high refresh rate is not good . I have dual  machine of Samsung s20  and 13pro . Buying Apple is not mainly for the high refresh rate , but because the battery of the Apple 13 series is too strong I m not because of this , I like really high refresh rates Apple does nt even say that it is a high refresh rate , it can only say that it supports the upper limit . The key point is to emphasize the combination of ltpo and promotion . Now there is a misunderstanding that ltpo  high refresh rate screen . I do nt know who started it  black line  That s right Totally global 120Hz , the battery life ca nt hold up , that is useless Everyone knows the benefits of global 120hz , but at present , mobile devices pay attention to the balance . Manufacturers also need to find their own balance point . Now the refresh rate is like the limitations of early processors , process technology or other factors will limit it , there is no way but to use full firepower , everything runs close to full frequency , and later developed to have large , medium and small cores , and different applications and behaviors give you matching different performance and frequency . Summary  The experience is not as good as Samsung Huawei , but it saves power I also have a small 7 in my hand . It crash to desktop once in two or three days , and I have to reset the settings . I ca nt stand it anymore . I tangle with 12p and 12 pm . I like strong battery life , but I m afraid that the pm is too big and the delivery is late . I ca nt stand it . Tears  I m so hard 12p Forget it , the battery is definitely not good , the status quo of my mobile phone is exactly the same as yours . I m mainly afraid that pm is too big , and I really ca nt wait I feel that the battery life of the 12 and pro this year is very bad Sister , how many batches is it now ? What batch ? Ask if do nt know , usually Apple s charging is really slow , the signal is really bad ? ?  Allow sad   Poor guy that never used Apple  The charging is really bad , at the level of Android 4 years ago .  The signal after 12 can be used but it is not good I think what you said is exaggerated . Normally , the signal is very good . Only in the elevator or in the basement can distinguish the good from the bad . Ordinary Android signal 60 points , 12 Qualcomm baseband 55 points can be used , then about the previous Intel baseband  Did you only used iPhone ? The battery life of 13pm can fully let you know that Android s so  called battery life is not good then fast charging make up is a joke Yes , after changing the 13 , I feel that the previous 4600mAh battery is fake .  Allow sad  The ipad pro 2020 is still very fast to charge while playing games It s very fast when it s not hot  two ha  I have nt used one plus , may I ask , is the system really that bad ? Do nt listen to them , the one plus system is pure , I like it very much Bro , you use 11 , how s it ? It s really very good . I have used all the flagships in the past year . One plus is pure and smooth , and I think the fluency is better than that of Apple . Usually we think that Apple s smoothness is partly due to Apple s good animation and icons , but one plus based on Android , OnePlus gives me a light feeling , which is really very pleasing . You can buy it and try it out and then return it . Do nt listen to what they say , the screen of OnePlus last year is a very good screen now  Whoever buys will regret it Ah , god , then I ca nt consider this , I can choose this screen . Want to buy Mi mix4 ... who will help me to forget it  allow sad  The effect of the front camera is hard to describe , but MIUI 13 is smoother than Xiaomi 12 ... The front camera is fine , I do nt take selfies anyway . just too heavy The front camera s level is just can scan the code , the ceramic is heavy , and the power volume button is easy to be degummed and dropped , and the others are ok  the miui13 fluency has improved a lot  I checked it , 225 g is heavier than the one I use now , I quit . If you do nt selfie , this price is still very suitable I have been using the P10 for more than 3 years with no problem , and I am not a Huawei fan I am still hesitating to buy the Mi 10 , but there are too many complaints on the Internet that the Xiaomi signal is not good Just anti  fans are talking nonsense . Apple is too worried about the signal , and Android generally does not need to worry about the signal problem . Someone upstairs complained about Xiaomi CC9  Every time I change my phone , I get tangled up . After all , the cc9 processor is not particularly good There are a lot of reviews with bad signals for every brand  two ha  It s really annoying ... It was said on the Internet that the starting price was 3499 . At that time , I was nt tangled at all . Now it becomes 3999 and I m not happy . The signal problem should not be big . My sister uses the P10 and Mi 9 , and feel that the signal difference is not big . She works in the development area on our side . Launch slowly , take a good care to optimize . This year s high  end flagships are all ruined on the system , and the level is bottom of the four major domestic manufacturers , freezing and overheating is a common thing . Even12 G ram is always kill the background , and there is more to say . I really did not expect such a rubbish system in flagship mobile phones these days  hum  Picture comment Ios and Android are two different platforms , they ca nt be compared , and Apple s memory is too small  two ha  It s not compare about running points , it s about killing the backstage Just changed mix4 , MIUI is much better than OriginOS This is the first time I bought Xiaomi , and the 11pro always feels that the animation is incoherent . You used originos and feel that is not good , either ? My mix4 feels fine , have you not turned on 120hz ? I changed it from iQOO Pro , 60hz , but I feel that the gap in animation is not too big , mainly because the aesthetics and ease of use of the system are a lot worse than MIUI Look at the video of Dami , if MIUI is considered to kill the background , other systems can be said to have no background  allow sad  That s a lot better in recent versions . The previous 12 g was exactly the same as the 8 g. It s already well , so why say it ,  Yunbei  People who do nt know it think it s still the same now ? Why 13p battery life is not as good as 13 13p has a high refresh rate ... Adaptive refresh saves power in most scenarios than a fixed refresh rate No matter how much you save , it s impossible to save more than the one without high refresh rate , right ? Not to mention that the battery is a little smaller . Can someone tell me how long does the pro screen last ? 200 mA less The Xiaomi Mi 10 system is too rubbish , I changed it too Others are worse , look at other brands , everyone is scolding everyone , Xiaomi is relatively good , at least there are not many machines , those who are using machine sea tactical , you really think that maintenance is better than Xiaomi ? I raised a bug in the community , but I have nt gotten any feedback . I mentioned it to Ying duan and Mr. Cao . Xiaomi s people said they had received it , but they still did nt change it . A while ago , kicked out the development and public beta , and it became a big problem . I asked Citizen Da Li , and he invited me into it . It stopped for a while , and then I was kicked out again . . . I wo nt use it anymore , I use a mobile phone still need to beg them ? What are you tossing about with a redmi note  two ha  My phone feels okay , maybe it s a low  end phone , it feels like the system is fine . My Xiaomi Mi 10 is really has a bunch of bugs , the bugs are actually acceptable , but you need to fix it , it will make people uncomfortable if you do nt change anything I have nt encountered it before , I just read the news on my mobile phone , and swipe on Weibo  Yunbei  These are all fools . Immediately , the mobile phone with the camera under the screen is about to come out . Now the mobile phone has only one camera , and now it have a physical fingerprint . Do you have problems with your brain ? Do nt always say Apple is good . No matter how powerful the processor is , what s the use ? Can it turn a mobile game into a PC game , or take off ? SE is really a mobile phone used by parents . No , the screen is too small , it is not suitable Apple s peace of mind .  eat melon  And the 4.7  inch playing game is uncomfortable  two ha  The 4.7  inch screen is not only small , but also the screen ratio is too low . The size of this body is almost the same as that of the full  screen 6  inch screen  s22 small is unique Do nt buy it , the hand feel is good , but the battery is smaller than last year s s21 , the battery life is definitely not much better , the person holding the s21 leaves a message Is the battery life of ONE UI not as good as that of MIUI Hongmeng ? I do nt play games , I do nt watch videos . You even bought the mobile phone that charges three times a day ? The same . The front is really nice , a dream machine . The charging speed is slow but tolerable , and I do nt know how s the 8gen1 perform . Even 888 is not good , let alone gen1 , s21 users say it s hot in summer Is it hot for daily use ? From the test , the bare machine feel not good I have nt seen it in a physical store yet , at least it s more comfortable than Xiaomi Mi 12 Touch it before you say it ? Are your just comparing online . . . But it should be more comfortable But it seems that only the processor of the k40 is better than this , and the others seem to be worse  doge  , especially the charging  doge  The K40 looks much better than this one  doge  and it s hard to say what the taking picture s effect is without the tests  dogedoge  This screen should also be a little worse than k40  doge  This is definitely not good for taking pictures , MediaTek Yes , anyway , MediaTek s image support level is doubtful  laughs without saying a word  No matter how good a module you give it , it wo nt work My k40 game enhanced version , completely defeated this , the first launch 8  256 in May is 2399 , the Dimensity 920 has shrunk too badly Memory , flash memory , etc . , not the same level ... Now using the realme gt2 , taming the 888 does have an effect , but at least after using it we can know the 888 has been marketed and exaggerated How is the power consumption  glutton  The power consumption is relatively stable , there is no problem to use for a day , and it is also acceptable to play games OK , will it get hot when you watch videos or Weibo ? Does the gt2 screen a little red ? No problem using it so far Is it heavy to feel ? After almost a year , the Snapdragon 888 is actually optimized in place by every one , and so many more than a thousand mobile phones are all 888 this year  doge  Reno ACE has changed several mobile phone cards of different operators , it is always freeze , 4 G uses 2 G every day Do nt worry , friend , is the whole machine stuck , or only using a certain software ? It is recommended that you restart your phone and try it out .  hug  My mobile phone number sent text messages to the oppo official and was charged for two consecutive days without my knowledge . What s wrong ? WLAN is totally fine , even excellent  But the data traffic is really bad After you change the SIM card of another operator and restart the phone , can you still only search and use the 2 G network ?  doubt  ace2 is also very stuck   865 s 10u has already beaten 990 s mate30p  School Season  MIUI looks good on the surface ... A bunch of bugs , I ca nt use it emmm fortunately , I can endure so many bugs for the time being , at least the humanization is the best in China What you have in your hand is my standby machine  kneeling  and it s already forgotten No , the experience of 10u is terrible . Except for taking pictures , it is not as good as mate30pro in all aspects . The battery life of mate30pro is almost twice that of Xiaomi 10u . I have never used Mate30Pro , my 10u battery life is basically about 7 hours , can Mate30Pro reach 14 hours ? Even if you were touting it , you should nt brag like that , right ?  Black LineBlack Line  It s really can ... The overall experience is not a single parameter . Even if the findX3 is a z motor , the experience is better than that of OnePlus . Do you know what I mean ? Experience experience , not parameter experience Yes , I think the rotor motor experience is better than z   That s right , I think the 2,000 yuan e  waste stuck and dropped frame system experience is better than the stable and smooth system experience   Brother Pi , how about the 12p heat and battery life , can it compare to the Xiaomi Mi 10s ? The battery life is almost the same , the heat is not good What is the daily overheating compared to 888 ? 8gen1 daily power consumption is lower than 888 How about 10s of battery life ? Personal daily use is not as good as Huawei mate40p , and standby mode is not as strong as Huawei s MIUI power consumption optimization is really bad  angry  EMUI is really good in this regard  Heart   Heart  Love Pi Ge  Heart  The vivo system experience is too far from Xiaomi It s fine , the daily use is very smooth , and there are no bugs , and I do nt seem to have used the small window  two ha  That s stable It s enough to be stable , and the little window , even dog does nt need to  kneel  vivo is only 1.0 Originos 1.0  Funtouch OS 11 Why do you all say s10 like this ?  Allow sad  The propaganda slogan at that time , the 10th generation , was ahead of the times , plus the overall punching holes later , it can be regarded as a leader . At that time , it started punching , but the big grooving is really not good  looking  allow sad  , the p40 series is like the s10  allow sad  The s10  punch is not as big as the p40  doge  The advertisements at that time , and the appearance of the tenth generation is still very good today , and it is very sufficient . Basically , they are all nail households . The battery life is too poor , the appearance is super good , and it is still very good after 2 years My friend SIO can still work after changing the battery , and it s one UI2 . Do nt buy Xiaomi , you can buy everything of this brand except mobile phones , from Mi 10 users  experience Mi 10Pro works great , thanks Then you continue to use it , I m just talking about subjective feelings Of course , 10Pro is much easier to use than 10  two ha  Mi 10 is okay  single dog  I have one as the main machine Come on , I used two of my friends   , and both of them regret it . It s either stuck or crashed , and the battery become bad recently . So serious  dumbfounded  I personally think that the battery is a bit bad , maybe it s a miui problem . Usually wireless charging is convenient , so I do nt care too much . The bug I encountered is that there is a problem when adjusting the brightness . Others like games or daily use are still ok every day .  Why is there no CIVI  DOGE  The processor is not good 778 for daily use , very good , I changed from Xiaomi 11 It s not good to play games The appearance of civi , if you add 870  eat melon  , it is perfect That will be Xiaomi 12X  Plum  10s , civi and Honor 60 which one is better ? In fact , it is more like the note10  . The screen of this machine back then is also very good even now . Do nt ask me how I know it . I have been using it as a main machine for 3 years and I am reluctant to change it . While the battery is also durable , it feels very good and the apperance is at its peak . I do nt buy s21u because it s too thick , this s22u is a must buy S22 u is as thick as 21u , 8.9 The camera is not protruding , it is thin If only talk about the lens protrudes , it is indeed smaller than the 21 My note10  battery is not durable at all  tearstears  I changed the assembly several times , new battery I m also with n10  , I made an appointment for s22u , the memory is not enough  Allow sad  n10  to be honest , it have no problems now , and it s even better to upgrade to 4.0 Me too , and then the battery ca nt hold up , and I charge it 2 times a day . Hahaha . It s not the same price , The price of 3,000 I considered to change the exploration version , but I read the comments that the battery is not durable , and then I want to change to the magic30  allow sad  I am using this phone , the battery is too bad  Yun Sad  Oh , luckily it s charging fast o yes Suddenly I feel that Meizu is pretty awesome  doge  My Meizu Note6 is still in use My note2 still works   Tears  My 2 has been broken by me Meizu 16plus is still in use , except for the battery life , everything else is pretty good I have already changed the battery once  Yun Sad  Where did you change it ? Meizu 16th is now stuck to death Mine is not stuck ,  Yunbei  Mine is 16x Not stuck to death is not stuck  Two Ha  What makes you think so ? Have you seen the blind test of Brother Zhan s original image ? I think the 11U is just average for taking pictures , it s overblown . Brother Zhan s original picture , blindly test , see for yourself . Whether it is good or bad is naturally inhabits man s heart The biggest problem with the 11u is the color , image , look and feel , but the photos are sharpened seriously , and the OnePlus 9p also has problems . On the other hand , the blue  green factory is not too bragging . Although the OnePlus is also from green factory , but the Big Brother x3 series is not specialise in camera , but its look and feel of the photo is good , the saturation is high but not too bright , and the scenery is well handled in all aspects include exposure but not sharpened seriously . Is Brother Zhan zhe digital chat station ? I just posted yesterday , you can rummage it In addition to battery life , Xiaomi Mi 9 is not only in terms of appearance , body design , feel , photography , sound quality , and screen display , which aspect does not beat other products in the same period ? Heat , camera , system stability , and most importantly , battery life , all of these are not good , and the screen is also average . The screen at that time was really bad . I work in a mobile phone hypermarket , and I have compared other models in the same period . Xiaomi Mi 9 is the best in terms of appearance , workmanship , materials , feel , photography , and performance release . The screen is an excellent presence even now . That s fine , you re very objective Battery life is really bad The Mi 9 screen was beaten to the ground by Mi 6 and Mi MIX2S  doge  the initial OLED , and the E2 of the rigid substrate , too bad  doge  In fact , I prefer Xiaomi Mi 10S , but I m a little worried about the charging speed and screen . IQOO is also worried about the screen . . . . . I usually charge wirelessly , I do nt have power anxiety problems when I m outside Are you holding this wireless charging in your hand ? When I drive , I put my mobile phone on the storage table , and it can be charged . It can also be charged on the desk in the work unit . Why should I charge it in my hand ? Wo nt I tired ?  dirty   dirty   dirty  In fact , do nt need to worry  doge  I changed from the 2k screen of the OnePlus 8p to the 10s . I did nt feel any discomfort . It feels almost the same , the battery life is really good , very smooth , although the sound quality has been cut , but it is still very good , 10s can be said to be the most comfortable Xiaomi phone I have ever used  Erha   really not blowing  10s and civi , honor 60 which one is better Taking pictures is a bit bad  allow sad  Look at the picture and say Laugh to death ... DSC  RX100 s is straight out of camera , your Mi s is post processed , is it comparable ? ? ? Did you see the picture ? Can you read Chinese characters ? Where did you get this picture from , is it accurate ? Besides , even if it ca nt compare to Sony , it is more than enough to beat 90  of the mobile phones Xiaomi mobile phone photos are generally blurry , it is difficult to focus , and macro is simply useless . Have you seen the picture ? Please private letter me without watermark original image , thank you  And this Wechat public account is ? The photo filter is very fake , including selfies , I have mate30 If you do nt know how to use professional mode , stop talking If you just want to take a photo at any time , but use the professional mode . After you adjust it , you will miss what you want to take  Erha  Agree , if ordinary people take photos casually , Apple and Samsung are really better than Huawei . If professionals use it , Huawei flagship can also take super good photos , but the screen s look and feel is a little worse , which is the biggest reason why we did nt buy the Honor 30 Pro You turn on AI and beauty , what can I do ? Use Apple took a picture , and then used Meitu Xiuxiu to pshahahahahahahahahahahahahaha  Just use your Apple , Huawei users wo nt boss Apple around , it s pointless Stop using Huaxing screen . Today , I went to Xiaomi home to see Xiaomi Mi 10s . Symmetrical dual speakers are so cool  allow sadness   tears  . Screen e3 is also fine . For 11s , it s very satisfying to change to an e4 . I did not see much difference between the K40 and 10S screens offline . I feel that the 10s screen looks better . I do nt know if it s because of my poor appreciation . After all , the 10S is flexible screen , and in some aspects it has advantages over hard screens . The Xiaomi Mi 11s should be a 120hz Huaxing Optoelectronics curved screen , which is the same model as the Xiaomi civi . It is impossible to use the same model as the Xiaomi 11 series . I guess it s about the 10u screen  doge  The screen quality is ok  laugh haha  , I feel that the frontal look and fineness is not much different from the 10PRO , mainly looking obliquely , the rainbow spots are serious Why is the texture of the iPhone always better than other mobile phones ? Can someone tell me what process is mainly used for the right  angle edge design used in 11 , 12 , and 13 ? Will this process also account for a lot of cost ?  And Apple s camera is not a big black frame , but the lens is transparent , which is also achieved by OnePlus , so that you can see the sense of luxury , I hope other manufacturers can improve this design  I have touched 12 pm , that feel is really bad , very very bad , and it ca nt compare with the radian frame of 11 . I personally think that the iPhone 7 feels the best in iphone . It seems that I expressed my meaning wrong . I mainly want to talk about the visual sense . In fact , I have not touched it , but I have seen it used by others . Anyway , it seems that the appearance of Apple is indeed high  end , and it is not as gorgeous as other mobile phones  color , just a simple visual texture , and other mobile phones do not have this effect . Although Huawei and Samsung also have advanced visual texture , it is very different from Apple s style . After Apple is changed to a right  angled edge , I personally feel that it has texture but no hand feel  Thinking   Black line  The so  called texture you want may also be available in vivos9  Yunbei  To tell you the truth , I am now planning to buy the flagship of 2023  the target model is the flagship of various domestic manufacturers  . The reason why I post a texture comment is to attract the attention of the people in the machine circle . By then hopefully they can design the product I want in 2023  not easy  Hurt hands There is also a program of humanistic care , which is very good  to bow  My Huawei mate10 has been used for 4 years  doge  except for the small memory , there is no problem I found the organization  laugh cry  It feels good to use , if I can , I think it will last another 2  3 years . Two or three years are too much  Yun Sad  I am still using Huawei p9  doge   laughing  Who is not ?  Haha   Haha   Haha  Mine is for standby  Smiling  My Huawei Nova3 is still in use , but the memory is insufficient I used nova3 for about two years , then it got freeze to crash  allow sad  silver  It s not stuck , just not enough memory It s really not a good product , at least the price is conscientious Conscience what , it s price can reduce a few hundred in a month or two It at least be willing to reduce the price  smile  I laughed so hard , people bought it for 3999 , and sold it for more than 2000 in a blink of an eye . Are you still proud ? Really conscientious . How much has been dropped since the release of mix4  Erha  I laughed to death , MIUI that garbage system can only be like this At least in Huawei Honor , you ca nt see such a machine as the K40 Compared with making garbage , we still have to look at Xiaomi . Who bought the mix4 , hahaha , there are all scolding voice . Really maintain value , this is the great Xiaomi company stack materials and assemble without brains The price is not too low . The first launch Mi 11 , more than 4k buy a disabled mobile phone  two ha  3999 , in addition to Xiaomi , who can give you the latest 2k Samsung material screen and processor ? Huawei s 8888 phones are still using domestic Zhou Dongyu screens  Allow sad  OPPO find x3 screen is not worse than Mi 11 video . . . . Get beat by Samsung . . . . Photo color reproduction is fine . . . Apple s video capabilities are unmatched , but taking pictures is not as good as the top Android Since long ago it s not as good as , only color reproduction can be used to compared But I still prefer to pick up the iphone camera , because of the smooth implementation , the icon animation of entering and exiting , the high  resolution real  time HDR viewfinder , the silky full  focus zoom , and the fast imaging , although the extreme image quality is poor , but the daily experience of taking photos with Apple is too good In the dream , Samsung can explode South Korea , Samsung is awesome . Samsung shooting video  Yun Bei  Neo5 has been used for half a year , it is very good  awsl  How is the system ? I think a lot of people complain about the orange system  Yunbei   Yunbei  And how about battery life Quite enough to use , the system also feels very good . I have used the Huawei P series and the Honor series , and this is the most satisfying one so far . Neo5 is okay I am also going to buy neo5 , it is said that 12  512 is only available online  sour  I persuade you to stop , the screen is uncomfortable to see iQOO9 video is not good , x80 fast charge is not good , the video and fast charge of nex5 are both bad  laugh haha  The details of nex are garbage , only propaganda , reluctant to really use meterial If the material is stacked particularly full , do you still buy something else ? The problem is that they did nt stack any The price is fine  doge  The price ca nt be lower If you say that , buy one for every phone , right ?  doge  Then I ll just buy iqoo and x , why should buy nex  laughs but does nt speak  Honestly , I am using both 12 and 13mini . Obviously , the power of 13mini is more durable than that of 12 . Check stocks , WeChat , Weibo , make phone calls , and others do nt use  eat melon  In this case , even the 11 has excess performance . 11.12 . 12mini 13mini how to choose Choose 13mini  Doge  Buy 12mini is okay ? Screen time five or six hours  doge  The 10U configuration is not out of date even today , it seems that the 12U will be full again  doge  My 10u still works fine , but the battery is not durable Mine did nt work well before , I changed the battery and it was full of blood again  doge  It seems that Xiaomi s 120 watts really hurt the battery ? I bough this 10U in my hand when it first launched last year . Now it can be fully charged in 17 minutes , but it is not very durable when the battery drops below 50  Erha  10U Forever God  MIUI12.0.15 version 10U is the strongest  tears  Miui without 12.5 is all strong  doge  It costs 199 to replace the battery , oh my god  doge  I switched from 12 pm to 13pm , and I feel that just the battery life is stronger for daily use . When I go on a business trip , I feel very safe . If I do nt play games , it s enough charge once a day and a half or even two days . I would like to ask , how is the battery life of 12 pm  cute  If you do nt charge at noon , it s barely enough to use from 8 am to 5 pm if you do nt play games  doge  Well , I bought a 12 pm  laughing  so just asked about the battery life really?Yun Bei  Really great  Yun Bei  So jealous Absolutely great Really ? I am very satisfied with the OnePlus battery life in my hand . The iphone x that I used before has too poor battery life and signal . Go check it out , the latest Apple even small battery lasts hours longer than Android Do nt boast , it s just longer than some Android machines Bro , is this boast ? 3000ma compare with 5000ma , and the battery life is still too better . How does this thing be boast ? If Apple also has 5000ma , do they still need to compare ? The battery life of the 13 series has beaten a lot of Android Then the next mobile phone can buy Apple .  whee  I m ready to switch to 13p from 12 pm My 12p size is just right now , but the battery life is much worse than my brother s pm , and I m still hesitating  Yunbei  Is it a lot worse ? Have you played any games ? Now I basically do nt play games , mainly is poor battery life in outdoor scenes . My brother s mobile phone is always on with AutoNavi Maps Navigation , and when I use my mobile phone at low frequency , the power is down more than ten percent faster than pm . Plus one , it s almost impossible to lift pm , the brick  doge  Yes , it s also inconvenient to carry it in the pocket . When I went to Mi s house , surprisingly an uncle was fond of the appearance of the note11  Khan  recommending the k40 , he is still not moved Do nt they read reviews from digital bloggers ? Middle  aged uncle , , in the mobile phone circle , what percentage of consumers look at reviews . . .  Yun sad  Do nt they know that the whole network is denouncing miui ? Why not watch digital bloggers Honestly , the k40 looks better than the n11 . But for uncle , K40 is not necessarily a good choice I took my mother to Xiaomi offline to watch . The top three of visual feeling are civi , mix4 , and note11 . Note10 really looks like a low  end machine at first glance . Spend all their money on soc , and the rest is castrated everywhere . Can it not be like a low  end machine  smile  I think note11 is ugly , k40 looks much better The same , I feel that the big silver flakes next to the camera is really ugly , and the right  angle border is not my thing . I remember that most of the cameras after 10u , except for civi and 11u , have adopted a design similar to the silver easy  pull ring , maybe for the recognizability  allow sad  I , who use x70p , express that no expectation  The reliability of taking pictures is too bad  The hardware parameters does nt mean anything  smile  What s so bad ? Taking photos is delay , freeze and the white balance is inaccurate . Looking back at the photos happen green screen . Really annoying . Start xianyu 13pmx , I understand ...  Khan   Khan   Khan   Khan  I was ready to buy x70p  Yunbei  Thank you for let me give up Buy Honor The new MIX machine is the first choice , after all , MIUI is much easier to use Uncle Yan , will MIX launch the first off  screen camera ?  Haha  MIX is Xiaomi s first under  screen  laughs without a word  Looking forward to  Haha  I will also switch to Android for my next phone , the signal of Apple is really bad  When someone sent a red envelope , when I saw it , there was nothing left I wo nt mention the signal , it s been always very poor ... The charging is also  laugh cry  The iPhonex has just been used for 3 years . It often freezes , the signal is very poor , the call is disconnected several times at a time , the screen will stay there for a few seconds after playing the game for a long time , and the screen does not respond . The experience is very poor . I m going to change my phone these days . I do nt want to waste so I endured it for a while , but now I ca nt bear it anymore . I have to wait for a long time to scan the code to order food ... got ta be kidding me Why my 11pro does nt have yours  laugh cry  Maybe the model is different . I feel the worst is x. My husband s 8 is much better than mine . Why is my 7p still very smooth after using it for about four years , and there is no problem to play games If the motherboard does not have heat dissipation on both sides , it will not be able to play games I ve been using my xr for 3 years , and it s still smooth to play games every day Envy , I would have bought xr if I knew it  Yunbei  Do you mean the iPhone that except for iOS and processors , has been defeated in photography , charging , screen , appearance , and thinness ? I wo nt talk about NFC infrared , the application is double  open , privacy space , split screen , etc , there is nothing , and it is not good to play games to dissipate heat . It takes more than 40 days to ship when you buy it 3 , 4 thousand more expensive , and it does not come with a charger . Can you believe it ? Some people really like to pay stupid tax So many people in the country like to pay stupid tax ? Only you are smart and everyone else is stupid ? Sales explain the problem , everything else is nonsense . Apple has not ranked first in the country . If Huawei is not sanctioned , it is estimated that Apple will have nothing to do Do nt talk that nonsense . Huawei s sales are all low  end phones . The flagship sales are not even half of Apple  s. Sales and profits are even worse . Apple will go bankrupt without sanctions against Huawei ? Laughing to death you rubbish Laughing to death . Camera , screen , appearance , thin and light are completely defeated ? How could you say that ? Are you sour ? If you ca nt afford it yourself , you say other people s buying stupid tax . It turns out that people who spend 10,000 to buy Apple are all do nt have enough IQ . Are you the smartest ? I m dying of laughter , shut up if you ca nt afford it , do nt be ashamed , use an Android thousand yuan machine and say that buying Apple is stupid tax , funny Do nt be sore if you have nt used an iPhone Are you Mi fan ? The sales of Xiaomi 11U far exceed 11P , which can explain the problem The design of 11Pro is not good , and the heavy border feels bad  whether compared to Xiaomi Mi 11 or Ultra  . Go to the store to experience it you will knowdogedoge  Indeed , but the weight is okay Xiaomi 11Pro may be the worst hand feeling in the Xiaomi mobile phone digital seriesdogedogedoge  Because the price  performance ratio of 11P is not high , it is better to add more money to buy 11U . If you have to talk about configuration , there is not much difference between 11u and 11p taking pictures , just two small cameras are worth 700 ? It s the appearance design that is worth 700 . At this price , it s not just consider about the basic hardware parameters like soc .  Yunbei  11U also drop a lot  I bought this in June for only 100 yuan cheaper in the store , but the 618 subsidy is directly 1400 yuan . Although Xiaomi made up 500 yuan .  bitter  But still a loss Honestly , 8th generation 8p , do you dare to say that it is stuck ? Which software can not open very smoothly ? The crash probability is lower than the current Android flagship The general software is fine , but a slightly larger game will flash back after two minutes of playing . Are you talking about Xueli 8 or Apple 8 ? There is no need to flatter Apple without a brain , the 8th generation is really not good now , but it is indeed much better than the same generation of Android A little bit stuck , there is no big problem Poor signal , 9 battery life is poor , charging is slow The storage of the s10 is a bit insufficient , but I feel like it can last for another year  two ha  Inserting a memory card  doge  Now I have absolutely no desire to change machine 128  128 have been inserted . The phone has 18 left , and the card has about 50 left . Barely available for a year . Profitable businessman , I can only change to the expensive super cup 512  black line  Mine is full of storage , otherwise it will fight for another year , the hand feel is invincible  two ha  It feels good in the hand , and there is no pressure to play with one hand . It s a pity that the power consumption is fast , plus a 128tf card is installed , a total of 256 g , the remaining is 60 g , the next one can only be replaced with the heaviest top  end 512  Breeze  I bought 512 for s10 , no fear , I wanted to change to a small screen , s22 is 1080 , and at most 8  256 , this could be a downgrade experience  bitter  Ay , now there are no 512s in the small cup and the middle cup . Force to buy top match , learn from Apple , too rubbish A certain red book has been bragging about xs max yyds , and many people even said that they sold 13 reverse upgrades , I express do nt understand Taking photos with xsm is metaphysical , all the female friends next to me say it s beautiful wosg I also has a XR in my hand . Except for the telephoto lens , all other lenses are the same as the XSM . As far as the front one is concerned , the Xr selfie effect is indeed better than that of the 13 , and the 13 is too clear to sharpen all the flaws on the face . Indeed  Yun Bei  , it seems that it was the first time to add smart HDR that time , but the foreigner said that they did nt like it after smoothing , and then changed it later . On Douban , it has also always been said that the 1213 screen hurts the eyes . A lot of people bought 13 and used it for a week and their eyes were uncomfortable , so returned it and used back to 11  Only 11 is LCD , right ? All before 11 The xs max takes good pictures , but the battery life is really bad I m worried that the Black Shark will disconnect . If it s really good enough , why do nt KPL use Black Shark , but use iQOO3 ? Is it really that Black Shark ca nt afford money , can afford stars , and ca nt get into KPL ? ? ? Think carefully Remember the vivo stickers on iPhone of the competition ? Advertisement  pick nose  Now what ? ? Have you seen kpl , the last iQOO Pro back light was also from Apple ? Do nt use what happened a few years ago to refute , first do a good job in Xiaomi s quality control . The quality control is not good , but the control evaluation is very powerful As a game mobile phone , you still want it to be light It is possible that IQOO and KPL signed for more than one year 65W super fast charging , lift  type physical buttons , 18W magnetic charging , 90 Hz refresh rate , 270 Hz sampling rate , three  layer cooling module , Not special  shaped screen , is nt it good ? OnePlus screen is a flaw As someone who does nt know it well , may I ask how it is a flaw Depends on personal reasons  It hurts the eyes because of the A screen . Some people are fine , but some people ca nt stand watching the A screen What is the A  screen ... Besides the OnePlus 6 , which other mobile phones use the A  screen ? Take a look at the same screen of the Mi 8 , and the adjustment is even worse  doge  I bought the P20pro , after all , the camera is still ok The battery of promax is small , but its battery life dominates the list  allow sad   two ha  It s hot when playing games , forced darken screen , hot hands right . I used promax with magsafe play Genshin at the highest quality for more than 20 minutes , and the forced darken screen appeared . It is recommended that those who love to play games should directly buy ipadmini . How is your realme gt neo playing games ? Do nt play games , just read novels , have you read the Jianlai ? Not playing games is the first , playing games can only be 60hz , there is no comparison It is estimated that the manufacturers will immediately flatter the 120hz , and Apple has always taken it off the shelves if it does not fit . Look at Microsoft , it is always the first one that Apple adapts to when it updates . In contrast , several Android phones that have been adapted to 120hz have no performance . Looking forward to 965 . But it is heavy  laughs cry  Which flagship machine is not heavy now . Both pro and promax feel drop . I buy pm directly . The tone of the master fairy tale looks good , it has the taste of green orange  not simple  Is this the effect taken by OnePlus phone ? Mobile phone photography can be played like this , it feels like a cartoon OnePlus pro s new feature Did nt OnePlus break the news ahead of time to say that the red data cable was canceled ? Does it still have this time ? Is there a white data cable released this time ? The color contrast effect is obvious . I feel like this photo should be more vivid in color ? But the master can shoot good works , I feel that I use it to shoot can not very good . Mainly shooting colorful scenes and sky It feels very suitable for shooting children s parks or Disney . It should be very beautiful . After all , a colorful place is needed . Hmm , would it look better to shoot rainbows ? The colors are really pleasing  look forward to  It feels a bit similar to the green  orange filter , but it s a little different . I want to experience it . The x5 is still not out  Allow sad  I finally changed to 13pro Max , I do nt know if I will regret it in the end  doge  Certainly . . The feel is so different . . The screen is irritating to the eyes The green factory screen is not irritating to the eyes , and only look at the feel when buying a mobile phone ? Xiaomi Mi 12 and Meizu 18 feel better Mi 12 , Meizu 18 screen is very good , feel good , is there any problem , is there any problem with good products ? Is nt it better than the mini stupid tax series ? Hahaha , I m waiting to exchange 13pm for x5  doge  I was looking forward to it , but it never came out , and the reno7 is not good either . The system was only updated for two years .  Yun Sad  I finally changed to iPhone How long will Qualcomm 870 be polished ?  Allow sadAllow sadAllow sad  I have a question , when the time comes to buy the redmi k50 , the new one , what should I do with the tempered film ? Xiaomi leaves the factory to stick the film for you Really?Pitiful  If you wait for 870 and you must want redmi , it is better to buy k40 now . Now the price of k40 is perfect  laugh cry  K40 will reduce brightness when overheat Apple will also reduce brightness when overheat  laugh cry  Until bleeding 870 dry I think you can consider k50 as an upgraded version of note11pro  allow sad  note10pro . Dimensity 1100 is a little stronger . Brothers who use x30 , do you feel that the charging speed is very slow , not like 68w at all , not as good as the Huawei 40w used before . Charging is fast  Have you tried how long it takes to fully charge ? About 30 minutes I see , the back  end brothers have been notified , yours are really a relatively case , we will analyze and solve it well , thank you for your support    Thank you brother Jin Be clipped away Why is the picture clipped ? The dual telephoto of Samsung S21U is much more powerful than that of mate40 Porsche Ten times the ppp , invincible , higher quality than 40rs . If Samsung can make a technological breakthrough and replace it with glass lenses , it will be invincible . Now it can only be said that the subsequent light changes of more than ten times can surpass the ten times of ppp . Do you mean that the 13,000 mate40 Porsche ca nt beat the 7,000  plus P40Pro ?  pick nose  Only ten times the telephoto ca nt beat it , because of sanctions , it can only be produced domestically , and the resolution is not as good as ppp at the same magnification You said it too . That s just Porsche , do nt feel how strong Samsung is Look at private messages . It s not that much more powerful , mate40Pro is more powerful than Samsung S21U in taking pictures I ca nt send photos in the comment , see private messages . Honor 60Pro is so strong  not simple  How bad can the 778 processor be ? Seriously , if you do nt play games , you can really buy a 778 mobile phone . The battery life is amazing after all . Three or four thousand yuan 778  allow sadness   allow sadness  Go check the 778 phone , other brands are also have some , now it seems that some only more than 1,000 , and more than 1,000 buy a mobile phone with good battery life , it is still very worthwhile  doge  Does anyone knows can tell me that how about honor 60 taking pictures  daily photos   Smile  Single cell 778 plus 4800 battery , it is fine  doge  How s Apple s battery life ? Never used before The battery life is good , but the battery needs to be replaced after a long time , and it is not waterproof after changing battery  allow sad  The battery life is related to the number of charging times , and it is definitely more durable than a model that need to be charged multiple times a day . 13  Shake Hands   Shake Hand   Shake Hand  Apple s battery life is worse This year s 13 battery life is excellent to the sky  digging nose  13pm battery life is the best yes Power consumption , small battery ca nt stand up to ultra  high refresh rate battery life But the 13 s 3200mAh battery can also dominate the list . Can Android optimize the high refresh rate ?  ErhaErha  13 is 60 , only Pro and Promax are 120 At Apple s conference , the battery life of the 13pro is better than that of the 13 Ca nt it open the 90 and 120 gears ? I do nt worry about the battery life at home , why ca nt I enjoy more As long as you turn it on , no one will use 90 , and then they will scold your battery life is garbage  like this Then make it an adaptive refresh screen . Now ordinary OLED substrates ca nt make self  adaptation You did nt protect it yourself . Saying that Huawei is rubbish , funny . If it s really like what you said , will there be so many consumers ? Are people stupid ? Ca nt see it ? In addition to not being stuck , Apple really does not more particularly awesome than domestic mobile phone . Do nt show your ignorance , you only know that not stuck Hehe , you know , you know , you complain about domestic products and talk about Huawei so badly . I did nt complain about Apple . I just know that it does nt get stuck . Is there any problem ? Depressed , please do nt tell me the word ignorance . Annoying Is it not ignorance ? Ca nt I tell the truth ? hw is already bad and garbage , ca nt I tell the truth ? The video shot is not good , it means there is a problem with the function . How to protect it ? The color of my mom s p30 photo is very inaccurate Anyway , I have used it for a year , and the pixels are still good I mean , the color of Huawei s photos is not accurate , but the pixels are OK . I would like to ask you something . I want to change my phone recently . Which one is better , S21 U256 or 13PM128 ? Mainly for battery life and taking pictures , not playing games The S21UItra battery life and screen time about 6 hours , and 120hz1080 13PM battery life and screen time about 9 hours . Smart high  speed brushing and taking pictures Samsung wins , watching videos Samsung wins , the game the glory of kings Samsung has no problem , I have nt played the others , and Apple is the strongest when shooting video , I use it daily and just found these  laugh cry  I do nt play games , I only have a few commonly used software in my phone . I usually watch videos , mainly for taking pictures for courseware , how is the 13PM signal compared to the previous XS Max ? Apple s signal has always been about the same  laugh cry  , Samsung s signal is slightly better Of course Apple , do nt watch those bloggers boasting Samsung I indeed like the appearance of Samsung  Doge  13pm top version The financial resources are not so strong  allow sad  Honestly , the straight out of main camera in the past two years is not as good as the n10  . The note10 is really beautiful to take pictures , , , although the night scene is not good , the color during the day is simply king , the note20u is a lot worse , but in the same period , the color of the mobile phone is still the king The photos of the note10  are really good when viewed directly , but you ca nt zoom in to see them . Once zoomed in , they are blurred , and even the words in the distance are not clear . Yes  Yun Bei   Yun Bei   Yun Bei  FOLD3 can  laugh  Fold3 is also 1200 , right ? Um I was disappointed when I switched from note10 to note20u ... as far as taking pictures , but everything else is fine Feeling also garbage  Yun Bei  Telephoto and a big battery do sacrifice feel , but that s still much better than 13pm  doge  In this way , Xiaomi s high  end seems to have completed . Samsung , Apple , and Huawei s fast charging have been beaten . Samsung and Apple , two cooling bad , one camera bad , Huawei screen bad , video bad , but why nobody buy high  end Xiaomi , obviously Xiaomi has beaten the three high  end royal brand , ca nt figure it out , ca nt figure it out  laughing  That s true , there are only four domestic manufacturers of high  end phones . Xiaomi s 5,000 range is 6  , and vivo s 5,000 range is 14  . Because of the sanctions , Huawei has also dropped to the same 14  as vivo . Xiaomi has been most aggressive in Huawei s premium segment . They release 4 mobile phones with 5000 range in one year has knocked down vivo , xswl , I do nt know if Honor can catch up with Xiaomi s 6  , if Honor can catch up , Xiaomi is really interesting  laughing  vivo can have 14  , I laugh yue Brother Zhan has posted on Weibo , please go to his Weibo and laugh yue In this way , Huawei s 100w is the most powerful . Samsung , vivo , oppo , and Xiaomi s high  end phones have been beaten . Vivo and Xiaomi , one is 14  , and the other is 6  . They take pictures and texture are bad , but Why is 100w not charging as fast as 65 , obviously 100w is bigger than 66w , I ca nt figure it out , I ca nt figure it out  laughing  This year , Xiaomi s high  end performance is still the third in China  meow   meow  If K50 Pro is not released again , I will go to Huawei  likedoge  March , no hurry  doge  Then I ll get a second  hand P40 Pro to play with  Likedoge  I heard that the camera ability of k50p is very good  doge  Now Huawei feels that there is no machine to buy , the m40 has been more than a year , and the p50 has no 5G. I feel a little bit less to buy anything . Huawei can only buy the old and not the new . The price of the Mate 40 series is too abnormal . If the performance requirements are not high , I think the more than 3,000 P40 Pro is pretty good now  Erha  Frost silver is also very beautiful , I m going to buy one to collect now  liked oge  I have used the p40Pro and sold it because I could nt stand the single  speaker and z  axis motor . Now that I think about it , that machine is pretty good . Except these two are very rubbish , the others are very strong  Yun Bei  After buying , remember to share how the Hongmeng system is  doge  Hongmeng has much more bugs than my MIUI It s dangerous for you to say that Blind guess Huawei is the worst  laugh without speech  Xiaomi Samsung is the best in Android Huawei s video recording is really bad , and the switching is not smooth and stuck  HUAWEI Terminal Company Yu chengdong HarmonyOS  HUAWEI phone Yuchengdong When it can be well optimized , I can also praise it once  tears   tears  smear Look at my tail  hum  Huawei is not the worst  doge  Apple Samsung vivo top three , Huawei and Xiaomi have their own winners and losers , OPPO and Meizu follow closely  doge  Thank you class representative for summarizing and saving flow  doge  Xiaomi s video recording is not good , but taking pictures is ok , Mi 11pro Video is better than Huawei  Yun Bei  iqoo neo5 neo5s real me gt2  big detective help choose 1 out of 4 The Master Exploration Edition is only slightly worse than the neo5 in terms of camera and motor , and has not been completely beaten , but it is basically better than the neo5 in other aspects . What about battery life ? And the system , which of the two is better to use ? The battery life of the master exploration version is average , the system is quite smooth , and no major bugs have been found so far . If you want texture , choose Detective , if you want to take pictures , choose neo5 . The remaining two are fire dragons . I do nt recommend it very much  dogedoge  If you are taking pictures , Master Explorer Edition should be better than the Neo5  black lineblack line  No , is nt there a video of the master exploration on Dami , the neo5 for comparison , do nt call me the reviewer just said that the photo of the master exploration version is not as good as the neo5    I want pro but  tears  a lot of people are not optimistic about it Why not optimistic  tears  I just want to buy a pro It s too difficult , the pro is so much worse than the max photo , only 800 difference , but the screen is so big SOS , the pro is 1800 more expensive than the 12 ? Mainly in photography  tears   doge  Actually , I do nt have much requirements for photography because I want to buy a camera in the future . The pro max is too big and I m not comfortable to play games with it . I use 11 to take pictures and I think it s okay hahahaha , after all , I do nt take pictures or shoot videos much . Either 12 or pro max , really , impossible to buy pro Hi , may I ask what happened to the pro ? I want to buy pro , thank you Just you like it is okay Borrow a blog to ask , will the x80pro be released in March , and will the blue factory update the x90pro in half a year this year  doge  I also want to ask , recently I want to change to x70pro but I am afraid that the 80 series will be released soon 13Pro is replaced by x70pro , the experience is completely downgraded , it is recommended to wait for x80pro The main reason is want to change to a machine that is good at taking pictures . Apple s taking pictures are too bad . I do nt know how is the findx5p X90Pro should in Q4 quarter It will be warmed up at the end of March , and it will be on sale in April  Motorola , single  handedly destroy the price of 8G1 , my superman   doge  Last year , the price of 870 was also very low  hee hee  870 is to save the overheat of 888 Enough to use , the experience of under the screen is still good  hee hee  This is just the tuning test piece given by Qualcomm .  doge  Dare to first launch with only 10,000 piece  But not much people buy it , it s purely for connotate Xiaomi  Bye bye  The price is not very high , but the configuration does not know how . No one s taking pictures better than Xiaomi 11u Ca nt beat Mate40Pro Can beat I have used them all , I used Huawei mate40Pro before , regret selling it and bought 11u . . . . . . Not that strong Very strong , I use it myself , how can I do nt know So have you used Huawei p50p ?  question  Really strong , I think it is the strongest camera phone at present , the p50Pro zoom ca nt beat 11U Yes , whether it s taking pictures or videos , it s too strong , especially video , it s even better No , no , the K30 Extreme fool Edition has been adjusted for a year , and it s still garbage . It s okay , especially in this season , it s really good , but it s really too hot in summer  Yun Bei  My nine  month motherboard burned down  Yunbei  Is Xiaomi 11 ?  kneeling   kneeling   kneeling  God , you are right , mine is the k30 Extreme Edition , it s really hard to use , the processor of MediaTek is unreliable I have switched to the master exploration version , and now I feel that the system is much better than MIUI in some aspects 12.5.5 is ok , the battery is not durable , others feel okay Mine is Mi 8 , it s really hard to use Mine is also Mi 8 , let s not talk about the signal being interrupted from time to time , mainly the battery is not durable , the company Xiaomi really wants us to change a mobile phone every year This signal is really rubbish . When I first started , there was a problem with the signal . Why do nt I find it difficult to use holding the Mi 8 ? What are you Mi8 ? Maybe you got the Mi8 that you received money Maybe the youth version , the youth version use the mid  end processor , it s stuck when playing games , the processor of the flagship 8 series is not that , my Xiaomi Mi 6 is still very good and not stuck for almost three years . And I bought 9 this year It is flagship Is there a good mobile phone with a good photo of the 2000 yuan ? Do not consider performance  Tears   Tears  Redmi note 9pro , within 1500 . The camera is the strongest and there is no one of , and it is much stronger than the others . Check out the latest videos from Dami . I do nt believe that Redmi Note 9 Pro can beat Xiaomi Mi 9  doge  Now the new Xiaomi Mi 9 is less than 1500 How could it not be able to beat One plus 9  allow sadness  already 2600 How about taking pictures , is it steady ? I have never used a phone that is too high  end . My OnePlus 9 feels very comfortable , and there are no obvious shortcomings . Since there is no Huawei  Erha  At present , more than 2,000 yuan does nt care about taking pictures at all . If you do nt care about 5 g , currently more than 2,000 yuan , it is absolutely OK to take pictures with nova9 . Huawei is good at taking pictures ? Nova is not as good as iQOO  Rabbit  IQOO takes pictures ?  Yun Bei   Yun Bei  A main game , do nt blow up if you like it Learn about Xiaomi Max . . Just a sacrifice of the market Something that has nt been released  ErhaErhaErha  Failed work ... Really the ignorant are fearless ... Xiaomi max made to the end of the third generation ? ? ? ? I mean it s a failure , I bought max2 myself Tell a joke , The tablet business was also once the sacrifice of the market that Xiaomi considered  Jerry  It s a pity , I bought the max2 for my mother , the big screen is really cool , and the battery is big . But mainly they ca nt keep the price down , so they want to start with the processor . In the end , the processor is not good and it s only suitable for light users Now overall the best one should be findx2pro  doge  The battery life of the x2pro is outrageously bad , worse than the x3 , the others are ok  allow sad  I feel that the battery life of the oujia has been average in recent years , and the battery life of the OnePlus 8p9p and the find in the past two years has also been criticized . The Android phones in the past two years are average , the flagship phone can not last for a day , and even the large battery ca nt support it . Still the price is too confident , the x2 is so , and now the x5 feels the same Except for Huawei , there are almost no domestic models that can stabilize more than 5,000 At that time , were you also the one who scold x2pro ? The x2pro is not that good , but the good and the bad are relative , and the latter is worse , so the x2pro is forced to be the best in comparison . In addition , if the product is not good , it should be scolded . I am a consumer who has a mouth and I have not wronged anyone . Bite me .  eat melon  Who buys will know , OnePlus old users are not as good as dogs Is the system maintenance too poor ? Those who can scold OnePlus are all old users who have spent real money and been hurt  Sewage  I have been using the mobile phone for so many years , only the OnePlus charging cable has been broken , and broke two , and then I ca nt buy the OnePlus data cable later . After checking it , I found out that the Oppo cable can also be used , and the price is half of one plus s I m using the 1  8Pro now , and I regret so much Is it really good looking ? The Android flagship color has a lot that more beautiful than this , or is it an Apple so it looks good ? Android really does nt have this color In fact , although the texture of the iPhone is very good , it can also lead the color in the past , but the color of the recent generations is still played more by the Android camp . Last year s blue , the picture is also good , but then the real machine did not have the effect of the picture . It is true , I will go to the store to see the real machine and then decide whether to buy it or not . What do you think , apart from OPPO that is willing to spend money on it , who else is willing to spend money on appearance craftsmanship ? First of all , consumers think that there is no need for bells and whistles  doge  How can this be the fault of Android phones ? OPPO , vivo , Huawei s appearance are all okay As you said , there are only three . .... God , plastic back cover , small battery , heirloom 1200W , this . . . The 12MP 555 is not bad , stronger than the s21u main camera In addition to anti  shake , it ca nt be better than hm3 12 million mode is stronger than hm3 Let s just put it this way , the Mi 10Pro in your hand ca nt beat the S21 knife product in terms of overall or SOOC quality . Well , definitely , at the same price , and the S21 was released a year later as a new product , and the 888 computing power is also strong But even the Mi 11 is not as powerful as the S21  Black Line  11ultra is awesome . Although the camera experience is not perfect , beat the S21 is completely enough . Small battery  refers to 6.2 inches , 180 grams be packed into 4000mha ?  Khan  The ancestral 12MP , finally directly beat a certain Mi s HMX ?  doge  I am using the s21 now , the battery life and heat dissipation are really not good  tears  Fire Dragon 888 are all like this , there s no way , and others are also in the same situation . We are discussing  Doge  and we also find that girls only use Apple  puzzled  It s not that girls only use Apple . I bought 1  just to play games . Do nt people decide what brand of mobile phone to use by theirselves ? Why bother with so much  It s none of my business what phone other people use . I m just telling the truth . Most girls only use iPhone s. I did nt argue or smear ... Why you say I m trolling I m talking about this yxh  black line  Most girls use Apple because they are good  looking in taking pictures , and the system is smooth , nothing more . If the digital series can meet the needs they want , they do not need to buy a pro . Buying a high refresh rate depends on personal needs , and there are boys and girls who buy digitals and pros in life . Why do you have to focus on girls to troll ?  Unexplainable  It s true that most of the people who buy Apple are for face , but not all . Those bars and KTVs use Apple in some large places . Those people do nt understand the configuration of mobile phones at all . To be honest , even if you take a Huawei Porsche to the bar , everyone else will do nt know , not everyone understands the configuration of mobile phones . I have a classmate who insisted to buy an iPhone 12 at that time . I told him to consider clearly before buying it , but he still regretted it later . Some people really just say they are not for face Everything you said made me feel that if you do nt understand the configuration , you wo nt be able to use it . If you use it , you just for face Tangled 9pro and 18pro , the only tangle is that the 18 system is good , but I want to experience 9p fast charging . too difficult  The only thing I m tangling with is the battery life , it seems that neither of them is good . The not bad one Xiaomi 11u , I do nt think it looks good  disappointed  At first , I torned among these three , and I went to see Xiaomi . Not as good as the official picture . Originally , I was going for the appearance , but after seeing the real machine , I found that the texture is not very good , and the R angle is a bit awkward , and the screen is not as good as I imagined , it feels no difference from Apple or even not as good . But 120hz is really smooth . On the contrary , I prefer the 11pro . Xiaomi s appearance is really not good , the camera is too huge . Xiaomi 11 series only 11 is okay 18 still have that screen fingerprint 9p does nt have ? One plus fingerprint position is low , and the use experience is not good Go offline and compare to know the answer The rise of Android is from the Snapdragon 835 , and there has been a qualitative change since the Snapdragon 660 Yes , samsung is not stuck since s8 The note8 in my hand is too stuck that out   Doraemon is afraid  , but the pixel2 is very smooth Note8 may be running out of RAM , I also have an se2 with a13 , and the RAM is too small that it always stuck . I laughed when you found a Fire Dragon 821 to compare  laugh cry  960 is not as good as 821doge  At that time , compared with the fluency , the 835 of Xiaomi Mi 6 just won the three generations of Kirin 960 , 970 and 980  doge  Now what ? Is it still usable ? The parameters have never lost , but the experience have never won ?  think  The Huawei mate20pro released in the same year as yours , I have no reason to change it now . It s hard , the battery is not good , and it s uncomfortable even changed the screen  halo  Alas , do nt buy Xiaomi , there is no real flagship , 2k , 4200mAh battery , plus 40W charging . A machine from three years ago can still be used today . Look at Mi 8 My charging is so slow and my power consumption is huge  black line  Is this still not replaced ? Huawei is not good any more . Please do nt take a part for the whole about Huawei . Huawei s new flagship is indeed getting worse and worse , but Huawei s old flagship configuration in 2018 and 2019 is not bad . If you really need to change it , then consider others  ok  Forget Samsung , only Apple is good s Samsung s image not strong enough ? It s far from Apple . I do nt think it s even as good as Huawei . My dad is Note20ultra . I ve tried taking pictures with high  end cameras . You re using a magic phone after all Samsung is good in the Android machine . I have used Samsung , Apple and Xiaomi , but I have never used the Xiaomi flagship , but Apple s max series and the note20u in my hand , I feel both good . Samsung really is okay , my dad s note20ultra is really good except for the inferior camera  compared to the flagship machine of the same price  , especially the screen , but I do nt really like Korean products , I do nt dislike the product Samsung , I dislike South Korea man , so I did nt buy a samsung phone Except for the iPhone , the only one has four sides of the same widthlick screenlick screenlick screen  To make the four sides the same width , any mobile phone manufacturer can do it , just make the other three sides wider , but to make the four sides same narrow is a real test of technology I m talking about aesthetic issues rather than technical issues . Apple s design logic is that if there is a conflict between practicality and aesthetics , they will give priority to practicality , but if there is no conflict between the two , Apple will choose aesthetics without hesitation , and Apple s four sides are equal in width has achieved in 2017 , and it s a testament to Apple s pursuit of aesthetics Apple is three sides , and there is a bang Apple that big thick border  laugh cry  The texture of the iPhone can not made by any Android factory laughing to death Equally narrow on all sides  Puzzled  Does bangs count ? The 13Pro does nt feel good in the hand , and it can be expected that the titanium alloy of the 14Pro will be much better  the camera has become so large but the main camera has not been obviously upgraded , and the telephoto has regressed . The 14Pro s 48 million main camera is more attractive . In short , I personally do nt want to spend one or two thousand yuan to buy a high refresh rate and poor telephoto , it is better to use 13 to transition . You have determined the features that Cook has not determined  good  The iPhone case has been started for three years , and of course now the basic configuration has been decided . If Cook has nt decided yet , he obviously want to quit . Whether the item is established or not is different from whether it is actually released or not , and the high refresh rate is also delayed until this year . Buying a 256 13pro series can also transition . The original price is 2k more expensive and can be sold for more money when it comes out next year . The point is to enjoy the high rate refresh for a year earlier . 14pro change the shell material ? Where did the news come from ? I think the pro series is difficult to lighten Everyone s choice is different . I have high requirements for hand feel anyway . The 13Pro feels so bad , although the screen has high rate refresh , it still uncomfortable to use . I do nt think it s worth it . If Pro is only strong in the camera , then I will not buy Pro Who shout that they want a flagship with a small screen , buy it quickly , if you do nt buy it , you are not a person  laugh ha ha   laugh ha ha  6.3 is also not a small screen How small is small  doge  Now the mobile phone with a 6.3  inch screen is the same size as the Xiaomi 6 , is that small Really , the Mi 6 feels amazing  doge  Looking forward to it , I hope it is a right  angle frame Must buy it 618 next year Put an eye here I ll buy it as long as it s not too bad What they want is a cheap small  screen flagship  doge  Ha ha ha ha Samsung s flagship camera is better than Huawei s domestic , both in terms of experience and imaging quality My note20u , taking pictures and recording videos at night is like shit , it s pitch black , it s really not as good as Apple or Huawei Samsung s nickname is the god of the daytime  DOGE  Escanor?Doge  Strong during the daytime , but at night ...  doge  Samsung s photo is the best , you can see that which time Samsung is not the best in blind tests I have used one plus p , the battery life really drive people crazy  two ha  Unless it s outdoor work , I do nt really think battery life is too much of a problem . Someone complained about the low battery life of the Apple Watch before , and the blogger asked in return , devices with high battery life like Xiaomi Huawei , will you really have good experience after buying it ? Personally , I also feel that since it is a battery , charging is inevitable , and sometimes charging is also an experience . So as long as there is no problem in normal use , it is acceptable for moderate use for four or five hours . After all , it is 80w . Maybe you do nt go out at all , right ? He probably did nt go out at all , so he do nt know what is battery life anxiety The actual measurement of the technology aesthetics next door . Oneplus 10Pro s battery life strength is the first of the new Snapdragon 8 phone , stable or not  dogedoge  Green factory battery life very bad Mi 11 system is too bloated I will never buy Xiaomi again , the system is bloated and slow , and there are too many ads Too many ads ? ? ? , you are talking nonsense , the ad has a switch It ca nt be turned off , after turned off , it s turned on by itself I think it s good , 2k screen is really good Can you watch WeChat videos ? I opened it and got stuck  Khan  Yes , very smooth  It s not easy  After using the Xiaomi 10Pro for a while before , I got rid of it . The experience feels the same as yours . The system has everything and offering everything the user needs .  laughs cry  The compromise is too much Ah ? Otherwise , provide what the user does not need ? Do nt you feel that your phone is treating itself as a master if they do nt compromise ? I did nt measure it , it seems that Xiaobai compared them , the v20 takes better pictures  allow sad  Single camera is better ? Do you have face ? Then even its big brother chrysanthemum is no match . Yes , Xiaomi is the best  doge  You may not like it . But smearit , is it interesting ? Is the V20 better for taking pictures ? Are you serious ? DXO107 dxo is just for reference , do nt look at the specific photo comparison ? V20 s poor screen , rotor motor , rear fingerprint , only single camera imaging  doge  Comparing pictures , is nt comparing who took pictures better ? ? What are you comparing ? You Mi 9 and Google compare which shoots better , or compare have more camera than it  puzzling  No , I bought an LCD screen and do nt need to worry about anything iPhone 11 fights for another two years How s the 11 signal ? not too good Now there is no LCD machine  Yunbei  Ca nt say no , can only say that LCD screen mobile phones are garbage Pretty rubbish , only Apple 11 left  sick  The problem is that the lcd has blue light , which is also very fatal . Pulling the eye protector to the yellowest can alleviate blue light . Meizu 18s is about the same price as this , but it sets off Meizu . The disadvantage is that the heat and the small power . So what do you think of this Xiaomi Mi 12 phone ? The 12X is very good , mainly 870 and the size , the 888 series and the latest flagship core overheat , suffer a lot in summer , and the mobile phone will be stuck when overheat , and the electricity will drop fast . Heat , getting stuck and hot , fast drop of electricity , then it is not good  Yun Bei   Yun Bei  Overheating , low battery , is it a Meizu phone ? Yeah , Snapdragon 888 , 4000mAh battery 9pro says it s too hot S21 too hot like a dog Is there a flagship machine that is not hot this year ?  Single Dog  This year not have , last year s are not so hot hahaha 9pro is really hot to cry , and that charming battery life During the chat , I lost another 2  without knowing it . For example , the current s21 camera , taking pictures at night , is too bright in the automatic mode , directly correcting the exposure , and pulling it to the end will not be very dark , you can only enter the professional mode to adjust I feel like my s21  s camera is not even as good as the note9  s.  Yun sad  I said many aspects are not as good as the s7 , do you believe it ? It s not even as good as Note5  Doge  Note 10 instead looks better because the bottom is small that ca nt shot that bright  allow sad  Too bright at night is not what I want . Reduce exposure to the moon , but pulling to the end is also a mass of yellow light , the experience is really bad Yes , the focusing is also very weak . It is often impossible to focus in low light at night . You have to touch it with your hand to trigger the enhanced focus to focus on the distant focus , otherwise no matter how to tap the screen you will not be able to focus ... Anyway , the focus experience is not as good as the s7 Redmi 2199 can buy 870 full blood iron triangle 12  256 , is it better than friend businessmen ? The emphasis is on experience , and also on the manufacturer s adjusting Die of laughter , now you do nt compare processors , but experience , as if you have experienced it in depth , Honestly , although the processor of Honor 50 is not the flagship , the user experience is much better than that of the garbage K40 . It is simply a complete victory . Hello , what is the full blood iron triangle ? Iqooz5 So you re bashing friend businessmen ? Or are you bashing this today s guy ?  pick nose  Pi brother , which one to choose between 12u under  screen and mix5  Depends on demand What s the difference between the two , bro Comprehensive selection 12ULTRA Is this means caught the under  screen version ? It seems that many bloggers have said that there is an under  screen version  doge  But no one is sure when to release But mix5 has pro  thinking   thinking  Ah . . You made me hesitate again  Yunbei  One is March and another one is August , wait if you can , and the mix photo is not good So which one is more worth buying , Huawei mate40 or Honor magic3 or OnePlus 9 pro   Oneplus 9pro screen is good , I use honor , but it s pro How about magic3pro ? How much did you pay for it ? I bought 4866 from the first launch , the process is stable , and the photos are good , the most important thing is that playing games is not hot . I used Xiaomi 11u before , and it s hot to death  allow sad   allow sad   It s not simple  It feels all good , what s your need ? Take pictures but rarely take selfies . The daily storage file memory should be large , and the appearance of the mobile phone is also important  Apple is also considered , but I do nt know what to buy I think these three models are OK . How can there be so much offline profit space of 600 yuan you said ? First , although Huaxing s 120Hz dynamic refresh rate 12bit 1100NIT custom A screen is domestic , not better than OPPO s reddish 90Hz E3 screen ? Second , symmetrical speakers Third , 6.28  sized fuselage placed 4500 batteries  Same size Meizu 18 with only 4000  with new stacking processes . These do nt spend money ? These are not better than OPPO and Master Explorer Edition ? The floor host is right , blogger do nt think that you are very clever , everything is just as what you said ? Consumers have no steelyard in their hearts ?  doge  It feels like you re cross  casting to smear  split  But I have no evidence . Haha , the Xiaomi 12 itself is good this time . The small screen and large battery can attract many people , not to mention the configuration is good in all aspects . I suggest that you first figure out what this 1100nit is before you try to troll it ? Who is troll with you , you splashed dirty water , I just corrected you . Can I ask weakly , is the k40 much stronger than the note9 ? It is definitely stronger than the note9 , and also stronger than the note9pro , but it is not recommended to change to the k40 because the k50 will be released soon , but the k40 12  256 is only 1859 . You totally can buy it , the k40 s processor is much better t han the note9 Well , thank you , all of you are talking about K50 , is K50 really a lot stronger?It should nt be very low in the price , right ?  doge  Are there so many requirements to buy at this price , enough to play games and daily use is enough It s ridiculously strong , it s totally beat the note9pro on experience I m so envious The positioning is quite different . The note series is a mid  to  low  end machine that is just sufficient in all aspects . The large frame of the K  series is basically the mid  to  high  end machine configuration of the past year or so plus the latest flagship processor . First of all , there is no Meizu 17 in it My own understanding is that p40p ranks third so high , which is better than Meizu 17 . I do nt believe it . That does nt mean it s clear that you have 17 on your list . In other words , if the 17 is better than the third  place p40p on the list , why have nt they been evaluated together . However , the battery life of 995 s mate30pro 5 G is really good , and the same as 995 s p40p does not feel unreasonable The battery life of the Mate series is much better than that of the P. I said that the p40p and Xiaomi Mi 11 are because of the comparison . The two machines around me have poor battery life and ca nt compare with my own 17 . I did nt say 17 in your review . This is obvious .  What s the matter , it s clearly in my manuscript   dogedoge  It s over , but I ca nt say  split  NEX5 is not as good at taking pictures as x80Pro , and it is not as fast charging as iQOO9 series , and it is thick and heavy . Why should I have it ?  Sweat  The overall positioning is different . The charging is definitely faster than the X80 Pro , and the camera is definitely better than the iQOO9 series . After all , the core selling point of the X series is images , and the biggest selling point of the iQOO9 series is 100  watt high  speed charging . NEX5 will not grab all the exclusive selling points of these two , and NEX5 will definitely have exclusive configurations that neither the X80 series nor the iQOO9 series have . 100 watts for sure Say , what will they do to you , you coward Chang Shenteng  If you give him 2 million , he will immediately say 2 million , which refers to US dollars , Zhanbao s reputation is broken , and there will be no market in the future  call callcall call  Ca nt you disclose whether it is a traditional hole  digging high  quality screen or an upgraded version of the screen ?  disappointment  nex basically excludes digging . The Xiaomi Mi 11 Pro is obviously much better , the main camera is better , and 8MP is also a potential . What does periscope mean ? Is nt it the same as a telephoto lens ? Telephoto is divided into periscope telephoto and ordinary telephotodogePeriscope telephoto can do a larger optical zoom factordoge  What did you shoot with 3x ? I do nt think 5x is more commonly used than 3x . The far aperture of periscope shooting is small , the ordinary aperture is large , and it is trash with the telephoto , but the 11p periscope telephoto with the same small bottom aperture and smaller aperture really does not need to be praised . just as bad How is the main camera better ?  doge  The main camera is the same gn2 as 11u , you would nt think it s still 100 million pixels , right ? The hardware is good , but actually it can only be said to be about the same , it is not necessary to say that it is better  doge  In the professional mode , the ultra  wide angle will use GN2 to fill the middle part , and the edge will be processed by the ultra  wide angle . When it comes to weight , I ve have nothing to say about Apple .  Allow sad  The battery is not too big , the bottom of the camera is not too big , there is no periscope , there is no soaking plate for heat dissipation , and the body is not made of ceramics or other heavy material . How did it get 238gallow sadness   allow sadness   allow sadness   doge  Stainless steel frame , can it not be heavy ? The aluminum used in 13 is much lighter . The pro with the same measurements costs 200  What is the meaning of stainless steel ?  Allow sad   Allow sad  Can you really feel the difference between bright stainless steel and bright aluminum alloy ?  Allow sad  If you feel it carefully , you can feel that stainless steel is more advanced , but I still feel that Apple is deliberately differentiating  dogedogedoge  That fancy but stainless steel frame  doge  Mainly it is the stainless steel which is heavy . I heard that titanium alloy will be used in two years , and it will be lighter at that time . 12 series is Qualcomm , 12promax battery is very strong , it is acceptable that it takes 1.5 hours to charge full , with 20W  The screen is a top  level Samsung screen . At present , the best screen besides Samsung s flagship is the iPhone screen . The Apple screen on sale now is not good , there is nothing . It is not good enough if the 13 or 12s does not have a 2K120Hz screen . Are you serious ? You have to know that only the flagships of iPhone and Samsung can use M  series materials for screens . Now , the best material for domestic mobile phones is E4 , which is also the best screen you can buy except Samsung and Apple . . But compared with M , there is still a big gap  It s true that the M series is better than the E series , but how big can the gap be ? Can you see it from everyday experience ? But 2K120Hz is real . While , it is difficultor Apple to use 2K120 due to the small battery .It will not give you a good experience , even it has a good screen . It is really critical to change the baseband . The signal problem made me think that my mobile phone is a copycat phone . I checked online and found that it is a common problem . The xr also supports 18W. I bought Pinsheng Quick Charge with 18W , it charges much faster . Indeed , Qualcomm s 5 g baseband is still very powerful , at least where Huawei has a network , the iPhone also has a networknow  It s better to add two hundred and buy a mi8 Does the Mi 8 have an appearance at all ? What Mi 8 , it is iPhone X Youth Edition   Yun Bei   Good  worst cell phone ever  Just the experience is better than this one Yes , I am also very worried about this , it is unable to maintain in time , whatever . For example , the camera algorith m and desktop sliding experience of 10S is not at the same level as Xiaomi Mi 10 , alas What price corresponds to what adaptation  doge  , can you expect it to have all  round adaptation , just as same as the flagship machine ? The key is that the first product is also more than 3,000  allow sadness  , the optimization is completely unworthy of this price  Yunbei  Actually , thinking about it now , the so  called cost  effective models , optimized and adapted are all the same as abandoned babies . I still want to buy 10S , brother , what is the difference between 10S and 10 or is there any castrated ?  Love you  The optimization experience is different anyway , It is so bad that it takes 10 s for just sliding back to the desktop on a desktop . Also , the algorithm for taking pictures is pretty bad . There is no difference in other respects , it works well The screen , Samsung , vivo and OPPO flagships are all better than Apple s screen , but Apple s screen is not garbage , I think Huawei is better than Apple in taking pictures , and Apple is better than Huawei in video Come on , I just replaced the vivo flagship with the 8p inside , and I was drunk at the first sight of the screen . It s 108,000 miles away from 8p . Laugh , who ca nt talk nonsense Do you think everyone just opens their mouths and talk nonsense just like you ? Remember , people evil like you are only a few . Samsung is strong is understandable , forget the others . It s funny , you can compare it offline then you can know . Apple s screen is the same as Huawei s flagship screen . It can only be considered strong , and it ca nt touch the top Just the screen should make it be passed . It s not that Samsung does nt give Huawei screens . When mate30 , it said that it supports domestic screens , but there are better BOE screens made in China but they do nt use . Mate40 was also use a garbage screen , and the overall quality ? The screen ? motor ? speaker ? Only taking pictures can boast , even taking pictures is not the strongest Let me put it this way , until now I want to replace the mobile phone in my hand , but none of them can impress me .  In the process , I bought 11Ultra , V70Pro , etc . , and returned them after trying them out . I considered the fruit 13 series , Mi MIX4 , iQOO9Pro , OnePlus 10 series , etc . , and gave up after comprehensive weighing  . There is no perfect mobile phone , only the  main  mobile phone that is more suitable for you after comprehensive weighing . 1 , after buying mate40RS , I bought findx3p , mpp , iqoo8p , one plus 9p these flagships , as well as iqoo7 , one plus 9R , except for the 870 straight screen 9R , which is reserved for playing games , only the mpp bought in June and the new bought plus 9P were kept  allow sad   Handshake   Hand hands  All items are not the top , but the experience together is better than yours . You also know that you only used the P10 . If you have nt bought a new machine , do nt talk nonsense there . I also have the OnePlus 9P . I just used it for a week , and I am ready to put it away to bite the dust  dig nose  ?  Confused  Budget 2500 , want to take pictures better , memory 256 , screen eye protection , which mobile phone is better to buy ?  laugh cry  Realme Master Explorer Edition 2500 ca nt buy the realme Master Explorer Edition 256  laugh cry  2689 , two hundred more , you can consider the real me gt Xiaomi CIVI Okay , thank you Not suitable for the main machine , it will definitely overheat to make you explode Troll brainlessly , right ? I ve been using Meizu 15 for a month , and I have nt felt any fever after playing eat chicken for 2 3 hours in a row . I have used five Meizu mobile phones , and they are really overheated , since mx3 . My Samsung mobile phone will arrive today . Because of Meizu s fever and poor signal , I ca nt recommend Meizu mobile phones to anyone around me . The overheating was really serious before , but the Meizu 15 is really okay in terms of heat , but the performance is relatively poor . A professional forwarding lottery person , just use what you win , the probability of winning is so low , do nt be picky . If I win the lottery , then I will use it naturally . I just want to say that before Meizu 16 , Meizu has not come up with a good solution to heat problem . Only Meizu 16 began to use copper pipes to dissipate heat . Handheld 15p , it s not as bad as you said , do nt read a few posts and feel like you know everything How hot can 660 be ? That s all , continue to play the glory of kingeat melon  Dami , this year OnePlus is basically small repair and small supplements . The most important photos and screens basically have not changed . I suspect that this screen is just the last year 9Pro s screen been adjusted . The main camera of the camera is the same as the 9Pro , the optical focus is not as good as before , and the telephoto . . . .I wo nt say more , this year it is a bit of a mistake , Qualcomm has been disappointing for two consecutive years , and I am forced to nail the 8Pro . . . If Qualcomm still not good next year , I will buy the iPhone 14 Pro directly Last year 9pro was also quite bad , I feel that 8pro is also backwards The 8Pro has upgraded the main camera and upgraded the light angle . The 3x optical zoom also has independent anti  shake . The screen is better than the previous generation 7Pro . The 865 has no high power consumption and is quite stable . It really do nt have any problem   The 8Pro bought at 618 last year for more than 3,000 is really a great deal . I bought it during 618 in the first year and spent more than 5,000 . Yeah , I mean 8pro is better than 9pro , not even worse than 10 There is also a reason for Qualcomm went to seed . The Snapdragon 8gen1 chip should be much more expensive than the 888 in the same period . It can only castrate other places to be forced to cut prices . Ay , Android has been really difficult for the past two years , forcing me to buy an iPhone Next year , the nuvia acquired by Qualcomm will come in handy . I m looking forward to it , but I do nt know if it will be released in the first half or the second half of the year .  doge  Does coarse grain have a Samsung solution under the screen ? With the effect of Fold3 , do nt count on Samsung in the short term about under the screen  allow sad  Depends on the trade  offs , Samsung did it for the imaging of the front camera , Xiaomi is purely to hide the front camera , so the effect of the front camera is far worse than that of Samsung . Just bragging , Samsung s screen is blindfolded to lie to the nose , and the imaging effect is not very good Samsung s under  screen camera is more obvious than punch hole Samsung s own under  screen is not as good as the domestic screen manufacturer s solution  doge  failed and did not dare to market  allow sad  Samsung s current best e5 flexible screen  doge  can also solve folding , etc . How on earth about one plus 9r ? Is it worth buying a second  hand minimum configuration for two thousand ? Dami evaluation At 618 , I bought a black , top version for my mother . She used it very well . The battery can last for a day . Every time I went home and looked at her phone , it did nt carelessly download any software . I originally wanted to buy a second  hand s20 for 2000 , but I m fear of screen problems so I bought a 9r . The battery life of the s20 is very poor , but I am very satisfied in other aspects , so I have been using it as the main machine I bought a 12  256 for my dad and he used it very well The texture and feel are much better than k40 and neo5 . I do nt know how the Realme neo2 is . It seems will be very strong . The texture and feel are really good , the direct screen film is also easy to film , the warranty is still long , and it comes with a two  year warranty 618 2600 to buy the top with 9R is really cost  effective To be a backup machine , it does nt need that high memory The k40 is the cheapest among these . 8  128 Pinxixi 1579 , which should be the first choice . Handheld k40 , screen is too bad It s really screen , a rag screen What else do you want with only more than 1,000 ? Do you want 2KE5 ? Do you want 199 ?  PuzzledPuzzled  Where is this price If it were me , I would buy this 12  256 , 1799 Why did nt I find it ... Holding the k40 , the system persuades me quit  black line  I have nt encountered any bugs with the K40 except for sometimes dropping frames . I do nt have any problems . Looking at the Internet , I even suspect that I m using another mobile phone . The recent new phones all look like a bunch of homogeneous things with no desire to buy . If it goes on like this , after my mate20p is broken , I will just downgrade and buy a low  end Honor . Same m20p , now look at what I use  doge  Wait until next year to see if Huawei can make it out , if not , I will have to use Apple K40 is quite worth it if you buy it at a reduced price . But I heard that the previous system version is not easy to use . My spare machine is realme Q3 PRO  doge  There are really many bugs in MIUI 12.5 , it got stuck twice today Now the domestic product is not as good as the mate20pro My mate is that the battery is not good . I changed it once . Recently , it always prompts that there is a fault  cracked  and because of the epidemic it can not be repaired . Samsung s high refresh rate experience is very good , but buy with caution  dig nose  Why The cooling and battery life suck , no push service , rigid animations , and the system is full of machine  translated content . Samsung is doomed . If you do nt really love Samsung , do nt touch it . ps  my note20u did nothing this morning . Direct black screen , return to the factory tomorrow  allow sad  How many has good battery life with the 2k 120 both turned on ? The animation is indeed not the same level as Apple . What s wrong with Samsung ? I want to buy a Hong Kong version on Double Eleven to use   two ha  It s not very suitable for me  Yun Bei  It is probably in different directions with iOS , iOS is to help you make all the choices , Samsung leaves the choices to you , and the system translation is a mess  doge  You can experience it if you have nt used it before . Stupid tax , this was beaten by the enhanced version of the k40 , narrower chin , smaller digging holes , cooler pop  up buttons , lighter and thinner hand feel , more comprehensive system , cheaper price , give me a reason do nt buy k40 enhanced version  eat melon  Brag , Dimensity also brags 1200 to play normal games is half  and  half with 870 , okay ? The frame rate of the game may be half  and  half , but the power consumption of the game is absolutely 73 . I have used two MediaTek phones in the past few years , but now I am really scared . Back then , the Green Factory MediaTek p60 and Qualcomm 660 were used on the same phone , and they said that the performance is similar , which is outrageous  doge  K40 g is Dimensity ... 1200 is really not bad , you will know after using it If it is really similar , I will give two options , 870 and 1200 . Guess which side has more people  doge  Coincidentally , I have a k40 g  hee hee  The screen sucks Everyone s eyes feel different , you re right It does nt matter , it s a cheap phone anyway The adjustment of the blue and green two major factories is not as good as Huawei and Honor , but much better than the world s top 500 companies When you say this , please take a look at findx3p s too overheated to doubt life when playing games . The battery life also too suck You said this , which 888 is not hot when playing games , who is the first 888 to burn the motherboard , just tell the truth But this yours is hotter than the grain factory . Does it have something to do with whether it burn the motherboard ? Overheated but ca nt be scolded ? Voltage regulation is the same as 888 mobile phone Chang Shenteng  Do nt look at the frame rate ? Have you look ? 11 very stable Use another machine before you bark  The current k30u is very good , I use it without any problem There are always people saying that the signal is poor . But I ve never had a bad signal when using it . 11Pro , no signal when entering the supermarket  Erha  It may be the problem with the operator s deployment of base stations . Do nt whitewash it . Where other phones have signals , only Apple does nt . Is this also the operator s problem ? It really does nt feel much if do nt play games . When I play games , I m so anxious that I want to smash my phone  two ha  Wi  Fi around me is all pretty good . But I do nt play games much Wi  Fi does not feel like a big problem , but the traffic signal is obviously not as strong as other mobile phones , even not as good as iPhone7 My XS is really bad , and I am using Android at hand . There is no comparison , no harm XS encountered several times , I ca nt open the payment code when I check out , and there are many people in the back , which is very embarrassing I lie in one place at home , sometimes the video ca nt be swiped , and the Weibo ca nt be swiped when I click on it  laugh ha ha   laugh ha ha  Will the photo be cut ?  Haha  My m40p has been upgraded from emui to Hongmeng , and the camera and battery life have been cut  haha  laughed to death The negative optimization of photos is really an old tradition of Huawei . Back then , the P10 Plus was negatively optimized all the way to EMUI 9.1 . I m really convinced . Back then , the dark light is the best , but now there s a lot of color noise in the dark light , and the telephoto is nt as good as it used to be . Alas , the 9000 is comfortable to use , it s really annoying that Qualcomm was going to seed , there is no good soc to change the phone So I have already changed iPhone early , I have used P10P for more than three years , and the negative optimization has not been solved  black line  Me too , I really do nt know why , especially taking pictures , the focus is too slow after Hongmeng , and the video shooting process is stuck , but after shooting , it looks normal . There was no such thing before . Probably want you to buy p50  doge  hahaha According to our internal estimates , the volume is about 90  of the huge motor on the iPhone 12 Pro Max . Upgraded from traditional electric drive to electromagnetic drive , it should be the most capable motor at present Which motor is the largest in the history of Apple ? XS MAX is the largest Is it better than iPhone 13 Pro max  cute  The 13pm motor is worse than the previous generation Which motor is not driven by electromagnetic force ? I am also puzzled by his statement . I guess that the rotary motor is replaced by a linear motor . MIUI13 battery life screwed up , and the experience is not good , please fire Jin Fan See , what kind of people are Xiaomi users now , Xiaomi needs to serve these people , why do you join in the fun ?  We do nt want experience , we only need hand feel  ,  There are too many anti  fans , we must kick all of them out  ,  The mobile phones are qualified when they leave the factory , so there is a problem in your hands .  Ha ha ha ha I really do nt know how you managed to be shameful on Weibo  doge  Because I bought the 11 , it burned the WiFi  I bought the 12Pro , and the Xiaomi community was attacked by the Internet . Go to the Xiaomi community to see by yourself , go to JD.com to see the responses to the bad reviews , and learn about the loyal army . Oh , you do nt need to understand , because you re just a soldier , and you say that we normal people are shamed everywhere , it s really funny   It has only happened once in nine years , what more do you want ? I died laughing , bragging at the press conference , but what is it like in reality , where did the confidence of being  indistinguishable from ios  go ? You can just use other products yourself , then it s done ?  Pick nose  The last time I bought Xiaomi , the 9  year Mi fan is going to leave . If you can , you can buy my broken mobile phone and I will change it immediately  laugh cry  But it is said that 12 batteries . . . It seems to be charging three times a day ?  tears  My 12 just arrived . I basically do nt watch videos at work . Check Douban , Weibo , WeChat and Taobao at work . From 10 am to 9 pm , I still have 30  electricity when I go home . How is the experience of 12 ? ? To be honest , I do nt feel anything , it just take pictures very well , nothing else is special hahahaha , because I always use Apple , so I do nt feel anything special I just charge it three times a day  two ha  No way I also switched from mate 30 pro to 13 pro . After upgrading Hongmeng s mate30pro signal is not as good as iPhone . I could nt take it anymore I do nt believe this , fortunately I m using it If you do nt believe it , I have no way . At that time , the signal of Hongmeng really make me headache . I do nt know if it is to control power consumption . It does nt work anyway . Then I sold it Mate30p , what version is it ? Sell or not Now both mobile phones are used , still the 30pro signal is better  allow sad  At that time , the signal was very bad , and many people in the club reported that , it was not only me . Then I sold it . Maybe the later version has been updated it well It was true when it was first upgraded , and the battery was bad , but it will be fine later on . Huawei mate20x feels completely enough , no need  doge  Same Mate20X user , I like big  DOGE  Watching videos , swiping Weibo and reading novels as a spare machine , it is amazing , but it is inconvenient to bring  doge  It s very convenient to put in a backpack , barely able to fit in a trouser pocket The configuration is not good any more The overall use is still very smooth , but the screen is a little bit worse Sure enough , the  smooth  between people is not the same Shake hand , still used as the main machine now . I use it as an entertainment spare one  doge  , still strong I really want to change it , but I already have two phones on hand . How is the quality of the screen of the Redmi Dimensity 9000 ? Hot eyes or not That broken screen of v20 , no matter what mid  range machine to change , it is pleasing to the eye Is it that bad ? I changed the findx3 but felt that it was not as comfortable to play with the lights turned off as v20  allow sad  Just turn on the night light , you can hardly see the screen when you walk on the road during the day when the sun is shining Honor V20 change to any 2000  machine will not hurt eyes , right ? I just want to change to a better one 720p 30Hz screen , feels okay The battery life is awesome Is there really some people think that 20w is fast , and they can boast that it is fully charged in half an hour , the ancestral 5w , a little faster can make them feels like heaven ? But do you know that Android and Hongmeng basically start at 65w , and even wireless is more than 50w , some faster is 120w , that is the real 15 minutes from 0 to 100 , not the speed that official website only dare to say 50  in 30 minutes So what , what phone do I use is none of your business It s normal to use anything , but it s ridiculous to be of limited outlook and be proud I am proud of using my mobile phone , why are you so inferior ? I just switched from the Mi 10 to the Mi 13 . Compared to the charging speed , Apple is really slow , but the power loss condition is much better than that of the Mi 10 . Relatively speaking , the power loss speed of Apple will be slower in daily use , but the small battery ca nt be saved when playing games  doge  At present , only the battery life of the 13pro series is indeed better , but after the 15.1 system comes out , various reviews are also saying that the battery life has plummeted , but unfortunately I have nt got my pm yet . Only talk about the speed and not the actual use experience , are you ethical ? iOS 3500mAh battery can last longer than Android 5000mAh battery , why do nt you say this ? Three thousand five is longer than five thousand , you really dare to say . Not to say something else , I have really used a 5000hA Android phone to play games with a friend s iPhoneXSmax 3170mA. I believe it s not much different from the 3500 . When I have half of the battery left , his phone is not only hot but also dead I switched from 13promax to 13pro because it was too heavy . I also like the big screen , but I ca nt help it . The hand feel is too bad . Add the case and film are more than 270 g , and my little finger ca nt hold it . But the pro uses an ultra  thin case or pitaka carbon fiber , it feels really good . As for the battery life , the max is definitely the best , but the pro gives me the feeling that it is enough to use . Watch dramas I have an ipad . When I go out , the size of the pro is more like a mobile phone . I wo nt choose max unless it can reduce the weight and thickness in the future haha It s perfectly fine for a big man . The pro is top  heavy . Really a nonsense . The two are almost the same in hands , and the perception is not obvious . After using the max for more than a month , I feel that the proportion is better and comfortable instead .  Where am I talking nonsense ? I said it , I also like the big screen , but it s too heavy , it varies from person to person . If you do nt think it s heavy , then it s not heavy , you re so funny I really hope that the appearance of the Pro will be the same material as the non  Pro in the future , so light I also hope to have a 6.3  inch pro . The 6.1 is slightly smaller , and the 6.7 is like a big brick . Imagination is always beautiful . You change the film to Schott . Thin and light , especially silky See if there are any needs for the rear camera . Honestly , the rear of civi is too much . . . I compared it with Mi 11 . About the post camera , I feel that the Xiaomi Mi 11 is still a bit worse . The 100 million pixels of Xiaomi Mi 11 are really bad . I have a Mi 10pro , and I think whether resolution , white balance , or filming rate , the hmx of ois is better . . . Could it be 11 negative optimization ? Xiaomi Mi 11 camera optimization is really not good To be honest , it s okay , it s not much different from the flagship machine . My evaluation is  in 2000 level , it is still considered the level behind Is Civi bad for taking pictures ? I have used this mix2 for nearly 4 years , 6  128 , and still feel that the performance is excessive , the program is opened in seconds , and the battery life and fast charging are also very satisfied . My mix2s has been bite the dust , and it is super hot when play games . I do nt play games  allow sadness   allow sadness  Just the daily application such as WeChat and Taobao , 835  6 G storage is indeed excess I only play King of glory occasionally , and I think 835 is better than 845  Longing  Let s see how long my 10Pro can be used At least 5 years , miui sets the lock screen to clear the background , and only keeps individual software that starts automatically . The speed is really fast , and it will not slow down for a few years , but it will not work for users who must keep the background . Xiaomi cc9pro , if you can still buy it . Entry performance , flagship camera configuration . With this new Snapdragon 8 , none of the cameras can beat it cc9p is too stuck . It s fine , miui12.5 animations are well done , making up for some regrets that the app is stuck when starting Is 730 g still usable ?  Doraemon is scared  I am using it . Now mobile phones are like computers . Celeron is also watching videos and typing ... When I bought it , 5 G just came out . I thought that 4 G phones would be eliminated in two years . Now looking at the new mobile phone around 5000 , the camera is not as comprehensive as this machine . Probably still need to use it for another two years Then why do nt you buy 10u  dirty  Probably because it s expensive The field of Honor design and workmanship is really strong I vomited . This brag , Dimensity 900 processor , a combination of Apple and Huawei , sold for nearly 2,000 , can only deceive those patriotic old people offline  laugh cry   doge  The price  performance ratio of 60SE is already very high . Do nt just think Dimensity chip is garbage . If you do nt use Dimensity s chip , you will never know how strong it is . What , it s 2202 , and it s going to launch 9,000 this month . Is the 900 e  waste configuration still touted ? You should believe Honor s design in this regard Indeed , Apple only dared to do this last year  hum  Honor still has the right to speak in terms of design Shui Shui , can you elaborate on the problem of the mate40Pro splash screen , my Samsung screen seems to show signs of start  tears  Mine also Samsung , I always thought that it was HarmonyOS that adjusted the driving voltage , some batches of BOE drive problems , and feel fortunate to have avoided the disaster ...  Cracked  Shui Shui said that it is an old problem of Huawei s foundry  Yunbei  Ask after the sale , there is no problem in theory . . It should be a touch issue After sales never tell the truth . They do nt know the time of day , if you ask again , they will tell you to replace at your own expense Really ? It stands to reason that GN1 should be inferior to GN2 , but it is not surprising that the GN1 adjusted by vivo is stronger than the GN2 adjusted by Xiaomi Although 4 g is indeed not as fast as 5 g , it is not surprising that the 4 g adjusted by company a is faster than the 5 g adjusted by company b. Misleading ? Is that a whole generation of communication technology , and it is updated every year ? Have you learnt Chinese ? The reason is interconnected , especially when certain groups of people are talking nonsense with their eyes open .  Smile  Die of laughter , Xiaomi can only take pictures well when the model is not announced  hahahahahahatoo happytoo happytoo happy  Xiaomi also took good pictures when it announced the model  hahahahahahatoo happytoo happytoo happy  Xiaomi s camera adjustment has not been very good , and the aperture of the customized GN2 is even smaller than that of the GN1 , which is very speechless  Sweat  I just want to ask , do the two phones on the 28th better than the Mi 11Pro in my hand generally ? 12p definitely is  haha  The upgrades are not significant . For example , the processor such as e5 , totally have no perception at all . To be precise , the 12pro is an iteration of the 11 12P is an iteration of 11P , and 11 has no 5x optical change There are 3 So is there any  Yun Bei   Yun Bei  Sell it and change to 12pro  Do nt need to worry about burning WiFi and motherboard , and 11pro is ugly to me  allow sad  The front face value and feel of civi just worth 500 , and the rear camera is obviously well optimized , the focus is fast , not stuck , and it can be shaken , which is better than mix4 In fact , I heard that only the packaging process is 800 yuan . Really ? Would nt the ov packaging process cost more than a thousand  Then go buy ov , cost  effective  doge  At present , the package of civi is the package of the top flagship . Even better than it in any way . Why is my civi focusing slow and taking pictures stuck ? Open the video , shake it , it s much better than mix The civi s rear camera and front camera are very good , the screen look and feel is also very good , the appearance of the mobile phone is good , and this Q3s is not at the same level 11 is very attractive , see if you have 5 G needs . It is so expensive at first . It will take two years until it is fully popularized . 11 or 11pro , sister give me a suggestion Mine is 11 . After reading Nayan s technical aesthetic evaluation , 11 is more c ost  effective than pro , and the camera looks better . Of course , if you have the ability , the more expensive the better . Ok , then I ll buy 11 , thank you dear National popularization , two years  How good it is ? I thought everyone wanted to buy a K40 , but the plastic middle frame and 33w directly persuaded them to quit , and I bought a K40 G instead . Except for the narrow chin , the k40 g s screen is beaten by the k40 . Only the charging and the metal body are stronger than the k40 , but the total charging time is similar . The Xiaomi s phone is not a hardware problem now , but the system is really not good . The hardware is the same as other brands , and the fluency is beaten by others . Maybe I think you should replace your ancient Redmi first , I do nt mean to look down on you , but I do nt think people with as much knowledge as you should use this kind of phone When the note12 of miui13 comes out , I will change it What is K40 G ? I plan to buy an IQOOZ5 for the elderly . I value the cost performance and battery life of the 778 G , and then I find that the price of the K40 is almost the same . Gaming enhanced version Come on , the screen is too bad . Is nt k40 G scolding in the community every day ?  doge  I did nt upgrade to Android 12 , so  doge  I want to know if there is an ultrasonic fingerprint , the fingerprint of Meizu is also very good to use  hee hee  The Meizu ca nt stick the tempered film , the ultrasonic fingerprint ca nt be used with the tempered film , it can only stick the hydrogel film and UV film  allow sad  It is very clear to tell you that with the tempered film is still easy to use , and the speed is still a little faster than the optical one  Is it full glue tempered film ? Meizu seems to be ahead in screen , fingerprint , and motor . I do nt know if Mi 12 can have an advantage in other places , otherwise with the performance of 8g1 , it is not as good as buying Meizu . 8g1 is way better than 888 anyway . . Not much stronger , the CPU part is like squeezing toothpaste , the GPU increased by more than 20  , but the energy consumption is outrageous , depending on the adjustment of Xiaomi , otherwise it will be trolled worse than 888  DOGE   Doge  Ca nt stick the film There is no problem with sticking an official anti  skid film , but sticking tempered film is a waste agree iPhone is not the first to use adaptive  spread hands  what ca nt be  puzzling  The adaptive refresh screen seems to be used first on the ipad . The ltpo on Android has only a few fixed gears , unlike ios , so many gears , so it consume a lot of electricity What s the use of you to took it so far ? I m saying does it can or not . You re saying that power consumption . Are you cerebral palsy ? Due to the dimming problem of iOS , there are only two gears above 60 , only 80 and 120 , stop your cerebral palsy behavior Then you really should read more reviews , do nt just talk here , scolding people everyday , you are so good . It s useless if the phone does nt have battery life . I also know how rubbish the battery life of the OnePlus 8pro is . Those with adaptive , are their battery life better or worse ?  laughs silently  Of course it s better than before . Are you okay ?  Puzzled  So why does the 13 Pro Max with an adaptive refresh rate of 4352 mAh have an awesome battery life , but the others ca nt ?  laughs silently  Who cares about images if buying redmi  doge  You ca nt go to the high end without images Is nt fakeme and iqoo selling so but the video is average ? They did nt say go high , redmi is going to go high  cute  Where is the video of redmi ?  doge  ? ? ? The k30p is very good for taking pictures , but few people buy it Player of the K30p zoom version is here . The photography experience is very general . The starting price of 3699 is really not worth . There is also a gap between 686 and iqoo s 598 . Only compared with the previous 363 can win steadily . 586 also depends on who adjusted it . It should be said that when is the Redmi image good ?  doge  K30P zoom version Everyone s aesthetics are different , I think it s pretty , but the problem is that it s like   especially with the case  , it s the flagship phone anyway , but when I take it out , everyone thinks it s an Apple , and I feel disgusted when I think about it . . This generation of design is really a landslide . The appearance of the Find X generation is unparalleled , and the Find X2 series is also have a great appearance . When it comes to the Find X3 series , it is nothing  laugh cry  The back cover has this technology , it can do any lens module , but it has to be done according to Apple , oh my god  kneeling  At the press conference , it was said that the camera module of the back cover was a ring mountain , and it was designed with an integrated streamline . It was said that the whole glass of the back cover was formed under hot forging . The audience was embarrassed at the time . Why is your Apple digging hole  doge  Their Apples are all holes  laugh ha ha  I do nt know why my Huawei is so green  shhh  The curvature of the curved screen is relatively large , so it will be a little green  meow  Yes Huawei screen is the worst domestic mobile phone , right ? Yes , the screen is Zhou Dongyu arrangement , and the quality is the worst among the flagship machines . It would be better to fill in cool colors Why sister Yi change back to Xiaomi ? find n ready to sell , no need for two phones Does the folding screen not good to use , sister Yi ? It s easy to use , but compared to the Xiaomi 11ultra flagship machine that is good in all aspects , some things are not good enough , such as taking pictures and charging , so I took the two mobile phones out together , and I found that I used Xiaomi more often . He has always used Xiaomi He changed to OPPO some time ago In what ways does Xiaomi 12 beat S22 ? In addition to the known charging speed and back cover material . videography Can the video beat the S22 ? Is Xiaomi too strong or is the S22 is castrated ? Samsung standard version is not very good at taking pictures . . . awesome is u battery capacity Really has small screen  surprised  , bought 11pro too early .  laugh cry  I am a Mi 9 user , and I feel that the 12x screen is a bit small . I plan to buy a real me master exploration version to transition It s okay , I can only use the small screen  allow sad   laugh crylaugh cry  I think the 12x screen is also good , but it s a little smaller . Recently , I ve been learning about the realme master , and wait the new machine released after 2 days . I d better look at Apple 14 , it s fine to have an adaptive high refresh rate I just changed 9 to 12x . The daily experience is very good , but when playing games , it will feel a little smaller and needs to be re  adapted . Well , I just think the screen is really small . Which is better , Xiaomi Mi 12x or Master Exploration Edition ? I heard that the Master Exploration Edition battery life is not good  two ha   laugh cry   laugh cry  It s OK if it s better than my current Mi 9 . Now I plan to do this . If it s expensive , I ll buy 13 . If I do nt want to buy it , just buy a sufficient transition . This was totally beaten by Xiaomi Looking at the price , is Xiaomi Mi 12 beaten to death ? So looking at the price , any car can beat RR ?  beg for mercy  Is this a car?They are all assembled factories , do nt pretend  Three cameras ? It feels good GT2 Pro looks good There is also realme s master exploration , but the price is a bit high now , and its dual speakers are just a display . . In addition , realme  including the whole series of Green Factory  systems do not have phone bill balance display and traffic monitoring , and privacy protection is also very basic . If you mind these , buy Xiaomi Mi 10s The machine is good , but such a system is too rubbish , let s buy 10s . . ha The system of the green series is less complete , and the daily operation is ok , but the lack of many daily necessary functions makes the experience discounted Successfully persuad me to quit neo2 . . . . I unlimited traffic care about this ? Not everyone has unlimited traffic How long have you not used the green system ? , has done a good job in privacy protection I m sorry , I was still using it three days ago , and my colleague took the phone away . Xiaomi is a curved screen , Redmi is a straight screen . See which one you like . It s almost the same , but there is no mobile phone better than Mi 10 about on speaker . Then redmi will be better for game optimization . But it still depends on whether you prefer a straight screen or a curved screen How about photography ? Are the two comparable ? Thank you  hee hee  But ... k40p Qingxue is really beautiful  Allow Sadness  There is no mobile phone better than Xiaomi 10 in on speaker Ok , thank you so much  Learn a lot  call  I have nt touched the curved screen , only the straight screen , I do nt know which one is better , I prefer the straight screen  hee hee  The curved screen feels good in the hand and looks better  Yun Sad  I think the MediaTek chip is reliable , but is the MediaTek chip used in Xiaomi mobile phones ? tsk tsk  doge  y1s1 , Xiaomi s Dimensity 1000  is the kind with ok battery life , you can look at the v40 and the real me , the battery life is even worse . But the comprehensive experience of the v40 and the realme s Dimensity 1000  is better than that of Xiaomi s k30 Extreme Commemorative Edition , ay , it s all caused by MIUI itself The honor v40 has a very bad reputation , especially the first batch of users , they are all Kirin users . And I have nt seen anyone saying that my X7 is good , except for the lightness . This is similar to the miui s abandoned phone , even if you do nt update the version , the game optimization also suck . Of course , light and fast charging are really good , but when it comes to the system , it s almost the same . Honor uses MediaTek 800u , do you pay for it ?  laughs without saying a word  Look at the price , if the price is attractive , it is not impossible  doge  I m afraid that it will disappoint you Who did you hear about Xiaomi s MediaTek garbage ? At that time , what I saw was the same temperature test of the Redmi K30s Dimensity 1000  of the same two mobile phones . The test result was the lowest temperature . What have you seen , just bark here again ? In other words , Xiaomi Mi 12 has no dynamic refresh rate ?  sad  Ay , I want to replace to the 12 , the Pro is too expensive , the k20Pro s battery in my hand is not good any more , otherwise I do nt want to change it , it s too long to wait another year Mine is also k20p ,  allow sadness   allow sadness   allow sadness   allow sadness  , ready to change to 12 12 is not as good as Pro , but Pro is more expensive  sad  tangled Serious people who buy 12 , all buy prodoge  That s cost  effective , do nt think about it It must start at 3699  3999 Is there a big difference between 870 and 888 ?  Black line  Want to change to 11u 870 to 888 is a downgrade  doge   Question  Really ? Although the performance of 888 is stronger than that of 870 , it is easy to heat up and consumes high power , cause the frame rate is unstable , so in terms of experience , it is not as good as 870 most of the time . Who do nt play games heavily can buy it . It s not as bad as they say . The current stable version is much better to use than before . I have 865 for comparison , which is better than 865 in many aspects . When the weather is cold , 888 will be strong That s true , but now the system does nt give it full play If you want to use at ease , I still recommend 870  hand  held 10s feels very comfortable  The k40 feels also okay , but the vibration and screen look and feel are a little less . Is nt the K40 screen pretty good ? Coarse grains are so outdated that they released a few months ago to use self  developed isp So besides mixfold , which one is used , why mix4 not use ? What s the matter between use it and have it ? It does nt matter , but why do nt use it since they have it ? And I saw a lot of self  media programs targeting vivo s chip , and some even took it apart and compared taking pictures with the same phone without the V1 chip . So why is Xiaomi s chip not dismantled and compared ? I tried the photo effect of the mix fold , and I ca nt compliment it   The mixfold is a liquid lens , and the image quality is poor because there is no mature technology It does nt even dare to use it , only the Mi fans are willing to tout it  laughs haha  Only Huawei fans like to smear In terms of quality , Xiaomi is definitely better than Huawei , but the brand influence Huawei is stronger . Do you still not understand the disassembly comparison ? Show IQ ? The one that uses a thermometer to measure noise and a vernier caliper to measure power ? It s not like that even if you do nt read . There is no way to whitewash it , do nt talk about these , 30  more expensive ca nt even play 4 K , let alone the picture quality . In this 618 e  commerce carnival , Xiaomi released the Xiaomi TV attributive sales champion , but the lack of the most mainstream size champions of 55 and 65 inches , think about why ? Are consumers all idiots ? Xiaomi quality control is the worst of all brands , no one of . There is a saying that the wool comes from the sheep .  Khan  Using the same money to improve the exchange is also a way . I have been using Xiaomi for 7 years , and there are all kinds of things . The quality is very good . And I do nt think you ve used all the brands and enough products of each brand to judge this sentence . I do nt need to use all brands of mobile phones to say this . Xiaomi s quality control has always been poor . Do you know how much the front camera is crooked ? Do you think capitalists are stupid ? Good things are cheap for you ? Xiaomi s quality control is famous for its poor quality , no matter quality control , products or brand influence , Xiaomi is too much worse Today s joke I do nt mind at all . The interactive reward in December is the redmi phone . After I received it , it was the same as the new one . It was very smooth to use and can also upgrade to miui13 . It is very easy to use . Playing the game like the King of Glory , eating chicken is no problem Did you upgrade to MIUI 13 ? It needs 40 points to upgrade immediately , I have nt upgraded yet , no hurry I did nt upgrade either , I feel 12.5 is pretty good to use . Courting envy ha Ha ha Still ca nt beat x2  laugh cry  The next  generation fold of the industry magic board stars may not be able to beat X2 . The green factory has been covering this machine for a long time , except for the feel is great , hehe  eat melon  Spit up brother , fold3 is much stronger than x2 , right ? Better screen durability and display effect , inside and outside 120 , can watch large  screen video , and waterproof , and finally support stylus to directly kill x2 , right ?  Puzzled  Samsung has a 93  market share of folding screens , do you tell me that the x2 is stronger ? ? Are you kidding me ? ?  Puzzled  Brother , Fold3 really ca nt beat X2 X2 is really awesome I m using both x2 and fold3 , the screen of the x2 is really normal , and the sound is clicked when opening and closing . Now if it exceeds 10,000 , do nt even consider playing with the x2 . Samsung s folding screen mainly relies on selling parallel imports . I got the K40 white and sold it after half day  laugh cry  It is far worse than the 1  7pro in my hand in terms of texture , and can only be seen from a distance So , do nt say anything about the design , Xiaomi is not unable to do it , it s good to fire Lei Jun  doge  The most obvious difference from the OnePlus 7 is the pot with the plastic middle frame . I do nt know about the curved screen and the lift . I remember that OnePlus seems to have a lift . OnePlus 7Pro is a lifting , which is comfortable with the full screen , but it is really heavy  Yun Bei   Yun Bei  Xiaomi 10s is actually pretty good , I do nt understand how 11 came to be like that The fillet of 11 is too ugly , I personally think . No , I have touched it in the past . It feels good , no less than 10 . The price is different  Laughing Cry   Laughing Cry   Laughing Cry  This time , one plus 9 is 2499  Love   Two Ha  The texture is required for money , but Xiaomi customers are on the line , spend more money on CMF on the configuration . There is no comparison between 4000 yuan and 2000 yuan Everyone is hot in extreme performance , but the power consumption of Kirin daily is low , and 90 frames eat chicken less than 4W The problem is that Huawei s battery life is not good , so what is the use of ? Because Huawei high brushes are more radical , the battery life is not very good , but it is better than some flagship with 888 Do nt you crap ? Better than parts . . . Secretly reduce the resolution , of course it will be lower Open your mouth and come  too happy  At first glance you did nt look at Xiaobai evaluation You should measure the Original God , how dare say ice Kirin Xiaobai database has 47  It turned out that Xiaobai was talking nonsense with his eyes open .  The IQOO 9 series conference is 730 tonight , do nt forget to watch it . The back design of this legendary version is really beautiful  cute  Classic , the secondary screen at the back is also good  looking In fact , it has no secondary screen . It s a decoration Well , I thought it was a secondary screen that could display the time or patterns on the back A bit like vivo X70 module It s very similar , it s all big rectangular modules It s a family after all  Understandable  Appointed . I also like this back design , simple yet uniquely identifiable . The lens bulge control is very good , looking forward to the release Now if you have a Mi 12 body , and then make the rear lens flat . That would be perfect  Xiaomi Mi 11 is the most difficult mobile phone I have ever used , bar none . It has a black screen when making calls , a stuck machine , a blurry screen , and the video is not compatible and can not be played . various glitches That s that you have nt used Xiaomi 9 Except for the poor battery of Mi 9 , I have not encountered the problem he said . The Mi 9 battery is really bad , I feel that whichever I buy , whichever battery is bad  bitter  It s broken , but it s not broken , it s just a variety of small problems , it s too bad to use  allow sad  , I even changed it back to the old Mi 8 phone for a while . Sister , Xiaobian will give you a private message , you can see it  I want to know when the cloud service will offer discounts  allow sad   allow sad  Is nt the black screen on the phone a function of preventing accidental touches ? The key is that I do nt put the phone to my ear . Sometimes I play games with the microphone , or watch videos while on the WeChat call with my boyfriend . The screen is always black , who can bear it Boyfriend  it s disrespectful of me to watch the video while playing wechat The station brother has said on Weibo before , the balanced upgrade means squeezing toothpaste . You think about watching the X60 series to X70 series images , which is almost not upgraded , still that set . But first of all , there is no price increase , and then all aspects of the screen , charging , and components are fully upgraded . This sincerity is already enough . And then to upgrade the main camera , ultra  wide  angle and telephoto , then the price increase of 500 is inevitable Charging with its own 66W will not be scolded . It takes more than 40 minutes for the flagship model to charge 55W , which is really unacceptable in China . Only apple , which is arrogant and not afraid of customer loss , dare to charge 20W for ten thousand years , The X70 s photo upgrade is still very large , the glass lens has reached the level of some cameras The upgrade data is very large , but the actual effect is not obvious . I bought the x70p for the first launch . Compared with the X60P of my classmates in the night scene , the difference is not big , but the edge details are better . Brother Zhan also said on Weibo before that the expect for next  generation balance upgrade should not be too high . I guess it is also a squeezing toothpaste upgrade . Of course , there are fewer upgrades for two generations a year . Compared with the X60 super cup , the x70 super cup makes up for the shortcomings . There may be new modules early next year , but in the second half of the year , there will be fewer upgrades . I want to ask how about the 9R experience , the system , the battery life , will there be app locking frames in high brushes ? I think it s okay , I did nt pay much attention to the lock frame . The battery life is OK . 120hz5 g runs faster when playing games . It s ok for daily use . Please take a look at whether station b is locked for 60 frames , thank you  love you  How to watch ? It s good , but the camera is not good . It s a bucket . OnePlus 586 has been polished for a long time . How can it be bad ? It should also be a general mid  range machine level There is basically no frame lock , and the battery life is quite good . It is very good to charge once a day . The overall cos11 is stable . It has all the functions it should have , but it s just that taking pictures is quite ordinary Thank you  love you  as long as it is better than 888 S22 s battery life is not too good  Bingdundun  3700mAh8Gen1OneUI basically do nt have much hope  allow sad  It s better to buy Apple mini  doge  13mini lasts for 4h30min , S22 lasts for 4h20min  laughs without saying a word  For battery life , forget about Samsung What is the battery life ? This phone must be used in power to use  DOGE  Handheld , ZTE AXON30ULTRA reported that the price is really fragrant  Call  How is the system ? It s alright , I like it without ads Does Nubia have no ads , so cool ? How about the system ? Is the ZTE axon30u easy to use ? I have always wanted to replace this one , it looks good , but now the phone is broken and I have to replace it Will I be scolded for recommending Xiaomi 11pro  doge  How about the telephoto and ultra Sufficient during the day , poor at night , the switching lens has obvious color changes , but it is still very fragrant okok  hee hee  Girls do nt know how to play with machine , so I would recommend a stable machine  doge  I recommended Xiaomi 12Pro to a female friendtwo ha  Me , too  pouting  Mi 12 is better 11 has night owl algorithm , 12 takes a bad picture There is nothing wrong with Nubia hardware , but the system seems to be not so easy to use , and the brand is not as good as other brands . Tomorrow s press conference at two oclock in the afternoon , you can take a look first  not simple  The first mobile phone to take pictures of stars Yes , and taking pictures of the Milky way ZTE belongs to that wake up early and catch up late episode It s amazing , I always thought Nubia was dead .  Laughing  I learned the other day that the Red Devils are also from Nubia .  Haha  It was embarrassing . It turns out they are still good now Both the Red Devils and Nubia are owned by ZTE . The technology is there , but the sales are not up . Sure enough , I learned something today . Both the Red Devils and Nubia are from ZTE  laughs  I really said two days ago that I feel that ZTE is not very good . My father used ZTE mobile phones back then .  Yunbei  Too ignorant  Yunbei  I still ca nt comment blindly in the future . ZTE s marketing is really not strong enough . I feel that there is less investment in marketing . I can learn from Meizu and open an account of Miss Meizu . Every day I see a lot of people are watching  laugh cry  Uh , to be honest , I do nt like the marketing model of Meizu very much  dirt  But I personally feel good  A clear stream How to choose one plus 10 pro and iPhone 12 Go directly to 13  Doge  13 is 1000 more expensive , it does not have a high brush , and it is not much upgraded compared to 12 . Decisive 13 , no lag when playing games , 12 has serious frame drops when playing games in summer , and the battery life of 13 is 1 to 2 hours longer than that of 12 , and the screen brightness is higher , the screen of 12 ca nt see the clearly in the sun , I bought both , real experience 13pm users tell you to buy OnePlus 10Pro  eat melon  , the main reason is LPTO yyds I used onePlus 8 . The previous system was very smooth . After upgrading the public beta version of color , it s very stuck . I m afraid one plus 10p will get stuck . OnePlus 9Pro is fine , at least it wo nt be stuck after a year , but my only concern is that the old model will not be pushed on the system update Why is S22  so much more expensive than S22 ? IntersectionWho can tell me  Er Ha  Last year s S21  was also the same price , but the S21  also replaced the back cover with glass  rabbit  Last year s S21  was 600 more expensive than this year s S22  . This is the rhythm that everyone should buy the s22  . Last year s S21 felt really good , but this year s S22 was really cut to speechless Ah remembered  Cracking  really expensive 600  Yun Bei  The battery size is different PPI is lower , the screen is worse  laughs  , much more expensive ... Is there brother who has touched the little cup , How does S21  feel The hand feel is very good . The offline store clerk said that Samsung s first launch this year is selling well at both ends  super large and s  , and no one asked in the middle   has not sold well for two consecutive years  . However , for heavy mobile games , you should be careful , and battery life is indeed a problem . Is nt it said that it s a little rough It depends on the size of the hand , I have a stubby palm and I have no problem holding a small cup . But the design of the small cup may not be so friendly to friends with slender hands . Better than Apple , but not as good as before In terms of hand feel , S20 exceeds him by 20 streets , and S8 exceeds him by 60 streets . Is the endurance of S22 better than 13 mini ? At 60hz , the battery life is definitely better than the mini , and the 25w short  term blood recovery is better than the mini , as well as better game heat dissipation and main camera telephoto . Is the 60 better than the iPhone 60 ? I just released a S22 , do nt wash it , bought it at 5799 on the 26th and sold it at 4000 on the 27th ca nt compare reality I does nt know 13mini , S22 has a fuck endurance\n"

k30p , k30u is an alien . I just went to the subway and saw a person using a real full  screen mobile phone with bare metal . The appearance is amazing to me . I look closely , it is a k30u . There is absolutely no problem that the front appearance beat a number of high  end flagships . This year , redmi does not as pay attention to texture as the past two years . It is more or less likely to be squeezed by various plastic flagships of realme and iqoo and be forced to change the knife method . But the k40 game texture is really top####[[[2], [31], 'pos'], [[64], [65, 66, 67, 68, 69], 'neg'], [[106], [111], 'pos']]
The workmanship of the two generations of k20p and k30p is completely no problem , and the workmanship is more than 3,000 level . Starting from the k40 , it castrated work configuration . Just to keep costs down with one set of molds . It has little effect on 1999 users , but has a great impact on the original 2999 users####[[[7], [11, 12, 13], 'pos'], [[9], [11, 12, 13], 'pos'], [[27], [30], 'neg']]
Is the MIX4 border very wide , I personally feel it is quite narrow####[[[2], [12, 13], 'neg']]
Pro6s is the most beautiful in that era####[[[0], [3, 4], 'pos']]
8  128 is 200 cheaper than Xiaomi Mi 10 , lacks 90hz refresh rate , lacks dual speakers , and is not as good as Xiaomi 10 for taking pictures . Has a headphone jack , smaller aperture than Xiaomi 10 , more fast charging than Xiaomi 10 , and the system is not as good as Xiaomi 10 .####[[[25, 26], [23], 'pos'], [[25, 26], [21, 22, 23, 24], 'pos'], [[25, 26], [42], 'neg']]
The system is not sure . It uses the brand new iQOOUI . Few people have experienced it . This iQOOUI is similar to hydrogen OS . It will take a while to compare iQOOUI and MIUI . The positioning of the two mobile phones is different , one is a gaming phone and the other is a high  end flagship , and there is no comparison .####[[[11], [3, 4], 'amb']]
I have nt used MIUI , but I have used vivo mobile phones , and I feel that vivo s system is not as good as the current Honor mobile phone system .####[[[28], [22, 23, 24, 25], 'pos'], [[10], [0], -1]]
vivo system optimization is not very good , iQOOUI is a brand new system , not many people have used it , after all , the new system is not very mature , I feel that iQOOUI is fine , a bit similar to hydrogen OS , relatively simple####[[[0], [4, 5, 6], 'neg'], [[8], [29, 30, 31], 'neu'], [[8], [47, 48], 'neu'], [[0], [0, 1, 2, 3], -1]]
The hifi chip AK1377a , the old stock of vivo , if there is a hard demand for listening to music on mobile phones , why not buy Sharp and LG .####[[[9], [0, 1, 2], -1]]
Xiaomi mix3 is too stuck####[[[0, 1], [3, 4], 'neg']]
The mix3 has been used for a year and a half , except that the battery life is not very good . After upgrading MIUI12 , it is very smooth  laugh but no words   laugh but no words   laugh but no words   laugh but no words ####[[[1], [18, 19], 'neg'], [[24], [28, 29], 'pos']]
I am holding the mi8 . From the first release to the present , it is updated to MIUI12 development version . It has been used for more than two years , and it still does not get stuck . You do nt know if you do nt use it , so do nt bb####[[[18], [35, 36, 37, 38], 'pos'], [[4], [35, 36, 37, 38], 'pos']]
Mi 8 is really easy to use , MIUI is my favorite  845 has no problem playing chicken games####[[[0, 1], [4, 5, 6], 'pos'], [[8], [11], 'pos']]
Huawei system is also garbage in my eyes####[[[0], [4], 'neg']]

Go buy one and try it out and you ll know , none of the current Android flagships can beat 13pm####[[[20], [19], 'pos']]
Is the double standard interesting ? When Apple s battery life was poor , you said that battery life and fast charging were not important . Now there is improvement , you just brag it on to the sky####[[[7], [12], 'neg'], [[7], [0, 1], -1]]
No one has ever said that battery life is not important . Apple s three major pain points , battery life , heating and signal , it has been solved two at once this year . The battery life is invincible . The energy consumption ratio is very high this year , basically not hot , but the signal is not very good .####[[[12], [16, 17], 'neg'], [[12], [16, 17], 'neg'], [[12], [40], 'pos'], [[12], [60, 61, 62], 'neg'], [[12], [0, 1], -1]]

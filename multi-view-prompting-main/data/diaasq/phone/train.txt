Come on , the same 120 fast charge VIVO will be fully charged in 15 minutes , and Xiaomi half of it has not been charged yet , take a photo freeze once per five seconds , it is recommended to refer to the  Xiaomi Bible  for Harman Kardon sound quality , the Harman is gone , just the rest is stuck .

To be honest , the 11u has fewer shortcomings and more bucket than the x70pro . The x70pro is obviously a bit of partial section , but the imaging system and screen are really good .####[([5], [7], 'pos'), ([5], [34], 'neg')]
11u is also very good in these two aspects , but the image stabilization of 11u is definitely not as good as that of x70pro , but it should be able to beat x70pro in other aspects .####[([0], [3, 4], 'pos'), ([0], [3, 4], 'pos'), ([0], [4], 'neg')]
About the main camera , they should have its own strengths and weaknesses . I think vivo wins in algorithm . The rest of the lens x70pp is a bit economical . In general , I think Zeiss is definitely good at improving the image . The main camera image should be stronger than 11u , but it is equal . The rest of the lenses are hard to say . This time , the x70pp focuses on portraits , which should be very strong .

The screen should be 11u slightly better ? 2k should be better than vivo s E5 luminous material , it seems that the screen of x70pro should be the same as iqoo8pro ?####[([4], [5, 6], 'pos')]
I only feel that the screen has an advantage , the imaging system is not as complete as the 11 , and the charge and battery is also average####[([19], [14, 15, 16, 17], 'pos')]
In my impression , the 11u only has an ultra  wide and no stabilizer , but I do nt have such high requirements for the stabilization of this lens for video recording , and the main shooter and telephoto are the most lacking .####[([5], [41, 42], 'neg'), ([5], [41, 42], 'neg')]

I do nt feel how much the 12pro s speakers have improved . The most uncomfortable thing is the way it is arranged . Watching videos and playing games on the horizontal screen will always block one , which is very uncomfortable . I tested it myself .####[([7], [15], 'neg')]

I hope this 870 model can do a good job of cooling , do nt make a copper pipe like the k40####[([21], [16, 17, 18], 'neg')]
Hardware heat dissipation is not the main problem of Xiaomi , it is enough to change the metal middle frame and add a copper plate . The main problem is MIUI . It is so bloated that if I do nt open or use many things , it will cause the mobile phone to switch pages and applications to drop frames and freeze . The continuous switching of pages under high load MIUI ca nt support it , and it will soon drop frames and freeze and the touch is not working , especially with the 888 . The 11p I sold is said to have excellent heat dissipation , but it is still the same , and the experience is not as good as the k30p .####[([9], [35], 'neg'), ([99], [115], 'neg'), ([99], [121, 122, 123, 124], 'neg'), ([126], [121, 122, 123, 124], 'pos')]
This year s 888 , I know all of these , plus the negative optimization of the system , of course not work , I also want to change to other brands , but I am used to using Xiaomi . I have been very tolerant of Xiaomi Mi 10 now . I have changed the battery , and it will not be a problem to fight for another year .
